List Starting with GCD Propositions:

## GCD
The greatest common divisor of integers a and b,  
where a $$\ne$$ 0 or b $$\ne$$ 0, is an integer d $$\gt$$ 0 such that  
- d | a, d | b, and  
- for all c ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$, if c | a and c \| b, then c $$\le$$ d

## GCD with Remainders (GCD WR)  
If a,b,q,r are integers such that  
a = qb+r, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)  

## GCD Characterization Theorem (GCD CT)  
Let a, b be integers, not both zero, and d ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$  
- If d | a and d | b,and  
- There exist x, y ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ such that d = ax+by  
Then d = gcd(a, b).  

## EEA (EEA Theorem (a.k.a Bezout’s Lemma))
Let a, b ∈ Z. Then d = gcd(a, b) can be computed, and there exist x , y ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$  
such that d = ax + by.   

## EEA shows converse of GCD CT is true
Let a, b ∈ Z, not both zero, and d ∈ N.  
If d = gcd(a, b)  
then  
- d | a and d | b  
- There exist x, y ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ such that d = ax+by.  

## GCD of One (GCD OO)  
Let a and b be integers.  
Then gcd(a, b) = 1  
if and only if there exist integers x and y with ax + by = 1.

## GCD DB (DB GCD))
Let a and b be integers.
If gcd(a, b) = d $$\ne$$ 0, then gcd( $$\frac{a}{d} , \frac{b}{d}$$ ) = 1.

## Coprime
We say integers a and b are coprime if and only if gcd(a, b) = 1.  

## Coprimes and Divisibility (CAD)
Let a, b, c ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$.
If c | ab and gcd( a , c ) = 1, then c | b.

## Primes
An integer p > 1 is said to be a prime if and only if the only positive divisors of p are 1 and p itself.  

## Primes and Divisibilty
Let p be a prime and a, b ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$.  
If p | (ab) then p | a or p | b.
