List Starting with GCD Propositions:

## GCD
The greatest common divisor of integers a and b,  
where a $$\ne$$ 0 or b $$\ne$$ 0, is an integer d $$\gt$$ 0 such that  
- d | a, d | b, and  
- for all c ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$, if c | a and c \| b, then c $$\le$$ d

## GCD with Remainders (GCD WR)  
If a,b,q,r are integers such that  
a = qb+r, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)  

## GCD Characterization Theorem (GCD CT)  
Let a, b be integers, not both zero, and d ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$  
- If d | a and d | b,and  
- There exist x, y ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ such that d = ax+by  
Then d = gcd(a, b).  

## EEA (EEA Theorem (a.k.a Bezout’s Lemma))
Let a, b ∈ Z. Then d = gcd(a, b) can be computed, and there exist x , y ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$  
such that d = ax + by.   

## EEA shows converse of GCD CT is true
Let a, b ∈ Z, not both zero, and d ∈ N.  
If d = gcd(a, b)  
then  
- d | a and d | b  
- There exist x, y ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ such that d = ax+by.  

## GCD of One (GCD OO)  
Let a and b be integers.  
Then gcd(a, b) = 1  
if and only if there exist integers x and y with ax + by = 1.

## GCD DB (DB GCD))
Let a and b be integers.
If gcd(a, b) = d $$\ne$$ 0, then gcd( $$\frac{a}{d} , \frac{b}{d}$$ ) = 1.

## Coprime
We say integers a and b are coprime if and only if gcd(a, b) = 1.  

## Coprimes and Divisibility (CAD)
Let a, b, c ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$.
If c | ab and gcd( a , c ) = 1, then c | b.

## Primes
An integer p > 1 is said to be a prime if and only if the only positive divisors of p are 1 and p itself.  

## Primes and Divisibilty
Let p be a prime and a, b ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$.  
If p | (ab) then p | a or p | b.  

## (Infinitely Many Primes (INF P))
There are infinitely many primes.  

## (Prime Factorization (PF))
For every integer n > 1,  
n can be written as a product of primes.  

## Linear Diophantine Equation 1 (LDE1)  
Let a, b ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ and gcd(a, b) = d.  
The linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c has a solution iff d | c.  

## Linear Diophantine Equation 2 (LDE2)

Let gcd(a,b) = d where a $$\ne$$ 0 and b $$\ne$$ 0 are integers.  
If x = $$x_0$$ and y = $$y_0$$ is one particular integer solution to the linear diophantine equation ax + by = c,  
then the complete integer solution is
x = $$x_0$$ + $$\frac{b}{d}n$$, y = $$y_0$$−$$\frac{a}{d}n, ∀ n ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$

# Congruence
Let m be a fixed positive integer.  
If a, b ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ we say that a is congruent to b modulo m  
if and only if m | (a − b).

## Congruence is an Equivalent Relation
Let m ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$. Let a,b,c∈Z. Then
1. a ≡ a (mod m). **(reflexivity)**
2. a ≡ b (mod m)⇒ b ≡ a (mod m). **(symmetry)**
3. a ≡ b (mod m) and b ≡ c (mod m)⇒a≡c (mod m). **(transitivity)**

## Unique Remainder
Let a ∈ $$\mathbb{Z}$$ and m ∈ $$\mathbb{N}$$.  
Then there exists a unique integer 0 ≤ r < m such that a ≡ r (mod m).

## Congruent If and Only If Remainder
Let m ∈ N, a, b ∈ Z.
Then a ≡ b (mod m) if and only if
a and b have the same remainder when divided by m.

## Properties of Modular Congruence
Let a,a′,b,b′ ∈Z. If a ≡ a′ (mod m)and b ≡ b′ (mod m), then  
1. a + b ≡ a′+b′ (mod m)
2. a − b ≡ a′−b′ (mod m)
3. ab ≡ a′b′ (mod m)

## Congruence and Division
Let a,b,c ∈ Z, m ∈ N and c $$\ne$$ 0 (mod m).  
If ac ≡ bc (mod m) and gcd(c,m)=1,then a≡b (mod m).
