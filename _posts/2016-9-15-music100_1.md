monophony: single voice (not necessarily one voice), unaccompanied melody

song texture:
- layered


chordal harmony (all parts move together, familiar choir texture)

polyphony:
- two or more independent voices
- most difficult to hear
- "strict" rules called counterpoint rules for combining melodies
- simple example: rounds ("row, row, row your boat")

How to do well?
- pick random songs and try to get the texture of the songs

Form (pg. 30)
- two things you can do, repetition doing the same, or something different (contrast)
- form can be small or on a (very) large scale
- note potential quiz questions
- common forms: binary A-B, A-B-A, A-A-B-A
