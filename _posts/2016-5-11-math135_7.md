## Union  
S ∪ T = {x \| (x ∈ S ) ∨ (x ∈ T )}  
## Intersection  
S ∩ T = {x \| (x ∈ S ) ∧ (x ∈ T )}  
## Complement  
_  
S = {x | x ∉ S}

## CartesianProduct
S × T={(x,y)|x ∈ S,y ∈ T}

What common sets do the following sets refer to?
**A** {m ∈ Z:2\|m} ∪ {2k + 1:k ∈ Z}
**B** {m ∈ Z:2\|m} ∩ {2k + 1:k ∈ Z}

**A** This is the set of **all integers**

**B** This is an **empty set**

A set S is called a subset of a set T, written S ⊆ T, when the implication “if x ∈ S then x ∈ T” is true for every x in the universe of discourse.  
To prove S ⊆ T , **we prove the implication (x ∈ S) => (x ∈ T).**
