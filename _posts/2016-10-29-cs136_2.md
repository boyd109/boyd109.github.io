## CS 136 Midterm Notes

module: provides a collection of functions that share a common aspect or purpose.

modularization:
- sharing among a team is easier
- can use helper function that help other functions
- good style to store each module in a separate file (if it breaks, fix module, not whole program)
main reasons for modularization:
- re-usability: re-used and construct large programs more easily
- maintainability: easier to test and debug a single module
- abstraction: understand what functionality it provides, but not need to understand how it is implemented

terminology:
- client requires functions that a module provides
- module dependency graph cannot have any cycles
- root or main file acts as a client

Scope:
- local only visible inside of the local region (or function body) where it is defined
- global identifiers are defined at the top level and are visible to all code following the definition

global can have either program or module scope:
- module identifiers are only visible in the module(file) they are defined in
- program identifiers are visible outside of the module they are defined in

Module Interface
- module interface is a list of functions that the module provides
- implementation is the code, interface is what the client would need to use the module
- interface is provided, implementation is hidden

Interface documentation:
- overall description of the module
- list of functions it provides
- contract and purpose for each provided function
- white box tests cannot be tested by a client

Designing Modules:
- high cohesion all interface functions work towards a "common goal"
- low coupling little interaction between modules

Interface vs Inmplementation
- information hiding where the interface is designed to hide any implementation details from the client
- security is important because it prevents the client from tampering with data used by the module
- flexibility to change the implementation in the future

Data structures and abstract data types
