The Course Notes are titled  
– Reading, Discovering, and Writing Proofs  

Statement:  
If n is an integer, then $$n^2 ≥ n$$.
Proof:  
Since n is an integer, either n > 1, n = 0 or n < 0.  
When n>1, multiply both sides by n to get $$n^2 >n$$.  
When n=0, we have n2 =0,so $$n^2 =n$$.  
Finally, when n<0,we know that $$n^2 >0$$, so $$n^2 >n$$.  
In all cases, n2 ≥ n is satisfied.  

When Reading a Proof, watch for
- Incorrect Assumptions  
- Incorrect Mathematical Steps  
- Flawed logic or too big of a jump in logic  
- Arriving a conclusion that is different from the desired one
