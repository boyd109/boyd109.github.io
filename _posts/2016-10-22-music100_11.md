## Medieval:
- written primarily to accompany religious services
- the oldest surviving written music from the middle ages dates from about 800, but may be older
- later in the period, secular songs, songs with nonreligious tops became popular
- polphony music containing more than one line started to appear

Plainchant:
- Greogrian chant after Pope Gregory I
- polyphonic, one line at a time
- syllabic, one note for every syllable, or melismatic large number of notes per single syllable
- neumatic small number of notes per syllable

Kyrie (plainchant)

Plainchant:
- flowing rhythm no clearly defined beat
- single musical line, without harmony
- use of modes, rather than scales

Secular Song and Polyphony:
- Troubadours and trouveres

Peritonus Alleluya, Nativitas  (Magister Leonin)

Two composers created first great collection of compositions Magnus Liber and Organi

Fundamentals of Medieval Music:
- based on modes, not major scales
- plainchant was sung in unison, with no harmony or accompaniment
- stylized courtly love songs became popular
- instruments varied
- polyphony was invented

## Renaissance Era:
- rebirth

Three major changes:
- new focus on individual achievement
- greater focus on the daily world than on the spiritual afterlife
- widespread mingling of cultures, facilitated by easier travel and spread of printed materials

- music followed imitation where the opening of the same melody is performed by different voices entering one at a time
- still primarily modal, although some more modern harmony

liturgical music: for the masses
motets: songs that have religious texts but are not part of the actual services
secular: nonreligious songs

motet: four voice parts, small choir rather than soloists
word painting: echoing the meaning of words in music

Chansons (France), madrigals (Italy - England): 3 or 4 voices, mostly courtly love songs

Dance music (see note pp. 113): there was always dance music but once again, publishing served a growing market.


Instrumental forms -> earliest published instrumental music. Wide variety - pavanes, allemandes, bourees, gigues, rondes, courantes, galliardes, sicilianos, salterellos, etc.

fundamentals:
- sound is smooth and homogenous
- harmony still primarily based on modes
- most prominent feature is imitation
- vocal genres includes Mass movements, motets, and secular songs
- motets and madrigalsigrals often use word-painting, which can involve dissonance
- instrumental music is either serious and imitatitve or light and dancelike

## Baroque:
- emphasis on scientific understanding and measurement
- interest in balance, order, and organization
- artists highlighted contrasting emotions
- illusion was highly prized

Vocal forms:
- opera: large scale stage productions featuring music, dance, costumes, and elborate plots and settings
- cantata: short-unstaged operas portraying a single scene
church cantata: religious subject
chamber cantata: secular subject
- oratorio: opera-like work with religious theme, not short
- chorale: protestant hymm sung in unison by the entire congregation with a simple melody and regular rhythm

conventions:
- Overture
- Recitatives
- Arias
- Ensembles
- Choruses

Instrumental Forms:
- concerto: instrumental work based on opposition of two groups
concerto grosso (large concerto) full orchestra and small group of soloists
solo concerto: full orchestra and single soloist
- sonata: chamber work for a small group
sonata da camera(chamber sonata): movements based on dance rythms
sonata da chiesa(church sonata): more serious movements alternating slow and fast
- dance suite: series of short, contrasting dance movements

basso continuo: strong bass line in Baroque music.

dance suite, not for dancing independent genre:
allemande: duple, moderate tempo, continuous motion
courante: triple. moderate to fast, motion often in running scales
sarabande: triple, slow, stately, accent often on second beat
gigue: usally 6/8, fst, lively, often imitatitve

Cantata (sacred and secular)
Work for vocalists w\instrumental acc. (choruses added later), poetic text
Italian cantata: 3 genres: lyric, dramatic, narrative

Passions
Passion plays (depiction of the last days and Crucifixion of Christ) - earliest known form of European theatre. Not surprising that music is incorporated early on.

Sonata
note that “sonata” is a confusing term that shifts its meaning over time.
several movements or sections of contrasting nature (not essentially different from a suite)
chamber sonata (da camera): dance origin
church sonata (de chiessa): more serious, polyphonic
small # of instruments (1-8)
