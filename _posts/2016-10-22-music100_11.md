## Medieval:
- written primarily to accompany religious services
- the oldest surviving written music from the middle ages dates from about 800, but may be older
- later in the period, secular songs, songs with nonreligious tops became popular
- polphony music containing more than one line started to appear

Plainchant:
- Greogrian chant after Pope Gregory I
- polyphonic, one line at a time
- syllabic, one note for every syllable, or melismatic large number of notes per single syllable
- neumatic small number of notes per syllable

Kyrie (plainchant)

Plainchant:
- flowing rhythm no clearly defined beat
- single musical line, without harmony
- use of modes, rather than scales

Secular Song and Polyphony:
- Troubadours and trouveres

Peritonus Alleluya, Nativitas  (Magister Leonin)

Two composers created first great collection of compositions Magnus Liber and Organi

Fundamentals of Medieval Music:
- based on modes, not major scales
- plainchant was sung in unison, with no harmony or accompaniment
- stylized courtly love songs became popular
- instruments varied
- polyphony was invented

## Renaissance Era:
- rebirth

Three major changes:
- new focus on individual achievement
- greater focus on the daily world than on the spiritual afterlife
- widespread mingling of cultures, facilitated by easier travel and spread of printed materials

- music followed imitation where the opening of the same melody is performed by different voices entering one at a time
- still primarily modal, although some more modern harmony

liturgical music: for the masses
motets: songs that have religious texts but are not part of the actual services
secular: nonreligious songs

motet: four voice parts, small choir rather than soloists
word painting: echoing the meaning of words in music

Chansons (France), madrigals (Italy - England): 3 or 4 voices, mostly courtly love songs

Dance music (see note pp. 113): there was always dance music but once again, publishing served a growing market.


Instrumental forms -> earliest published instrumental music. Wide variety - pavanes, allemandes, bourees, gigues, rondes, courantes, galliardes, sicilianos, salterellos, etc.

fundamentals:
- sound is smooth and homogenous
- harmony still primarily based on modes
- most prominent feature is imitation
- vocal genres includes Mass movements, motets, and secular songs
- motets and madrigalsigrals often use word-painting, which can involve dissonance
- instrumental music is either serious and imitatitve or light and dancelike

## Baroque:
