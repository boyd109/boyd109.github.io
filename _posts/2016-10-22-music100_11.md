## Medieval:  
- written primarily to accompany religious services  
- the oldest surviving written music from the middle ages dates from about 800, but may be older  
- later in the period, secular songs, songs with nonreligious tops became popular  
- polphony music containing more than one line started to appear  

Plainchant:  
- Greogrian chant after Pope Gregory I  
- polyphonic, one line at a time  
- syllabic, one note for every syllable, or melismatic large number of notes per single syllable  
- neumatic small number of notes per syllable  

Kyrie (plainchant)  

Plainchant:  
- flowing rhythm no clearly defined beat  
- single musical line, without harmony  
- use of modes, rather than scales  

Secular Song and Polyphony:  
- Troubadours and trouveres  

Peritonus Alleluya, Nativitas  (Magister Leonin)  

Two composers created first great collection of compositions Magnus Liber and Organi  

Fundamentals of Medieval Music:  
- based on modes, not major scales  
- plainchant was sung in unison, with no harmony or accompaniment  
- stylized courtly love songs became popular  
- instruments varied  
- polyphony was invented  

## Renaissance Era:  
- rebirth  

Three major changes:  
- new focus on individual achievement  
- greater focus on the daily world than on the spiritual afterlife  
- widespread mingling of cultures, facilitated by easier travel and spread of printed materials  

- music followed imitation where the opening of the same melody is performed by different voices entering one at a time  
- still primarily modal, although some more modern harmony  

liturgical music: for the masses  
motets: songs that have religious texts but are not part of the actual services  
secular: nonreligious songs  

motet: four voice parts, small choir rather than soloists  
word painting: echoing the meaning of words in music  

Chansons (France), madrigals (Italy - England): 3 or 4 voices, mostly courtly love songs  

Dance music (see note pp. 113): there was always dance music but once again, publishing served a growing market.  


Instrumental forms -> earliest published instrumental music. Wide variety - pavanes, allemandes, bourees, gigues, rondes, courantes, galliardes, sicilianos, salterellos, etc.  

fundamentals:  
- sound is smooth and homogenous  
- harmony still primarily based on modes  
- most prominent feature is imitation  
- vocal genres includes Mass movements, motets, and secular songs  
- motets and madrigalsigrals often use word-painting, which can involve dissonance  
- instrumental music is either serious and imitatitve or light and dancelike  

## Baroque:  
- emphasis on scientific understanding and measurement  
- interest in balance, order, and organization  
- artists highlighted contrasting emotions  
- illusion was highly prized  

Vocal forms:  
- opera: large scale stage productions featuring music, dance, costumes, and elborate plots and settings  
- cantata: short-unstaged operas portraying a single scene  
church cantata: religious subject  
chamber cantata: secular subject  
- oratorio: opera-like work with religious theme, not short  
- chorale: protestant hymm sung in unison by the entire congregation with a simple melody and regular rhythm  

conventions:  
- Overture  
- Recitatives  
- Arias  
- Ensembles  
- Choruses  

Instrumental Forms:  
- concerto: instrumental work based on opposition of two groups  
concerto grosso (large concerto) full orchestra and small group of soloists  
solo concerto: full orchestra and single soloist  
- sonata: chamber work for a small group  
sonata da camera(chamber sonata): movements based on dance rythms  
sonata da chiesa(church sonata): more serious movements alternating slow and fast  
- dance suite: series of short, contrasting dance movements  

basso continuo: strong bass line in Baroque music.  

dance suite, not for dancing independent genre:  
allemande: duple, moderate tempo, continuous motion  
courante: triple. moderate to fast, motion often in running scales  
sarabande: triple, slow, stately, accent often on second beat  
gigue: usally 6/8, fst, lively, often imitatitve  

Cantata (sacred and secular)  
Work for vocalists w\instrumental acc. (choruses added later), poetic text  
Italian cantata: 3 genres: lyric, dramatic, narrative  

Passions  
Passion plays (depiction of the last days and Crucifixion of Christ) - earliest known form of European theatre. Not surprising that music is incorporated early on.  

Sonata  
note that “sonata” is a confusing term that shifts its meaning over time.  
several movements or sections of contrasting nature (not essentially different from a suite)  
chamber sonata (da camera): dance origin  
church sonata (de chiessa): more serious, polyphonic  
small # of instruments (1-8)  


Concerto  
note later, slightly different, classical sense  
Contrast - two groups  
either solo concerto or concerto grosso (concertino-small grp, ripieno or tutti ("all")-large group)  

ritornello: contrast between the solo instruments and the orchestra  
reformation: church music:  
chorale: hymm with steady rhthym and simpel tune usually sung in unison by the whole congregation  
oratoria: large-scale work like an opera but is a sacred story not staged. (similar to Passion)
