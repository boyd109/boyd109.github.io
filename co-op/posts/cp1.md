My inspiration is Eric Jang's post talking about his internships [here](https://blog.evjang.com/2016/06/my-internship-experiences-at-pixar.html).

Waterloo's co-op program allows you to do 5/6 co-op experiences at (usually) different companies. I really enjoy this aspect because it lets you experience different companies, teams, tech stacks, and more.

In a more concise manner than [My-Story](https://jonathantsang.github.io/my-story) I want to delve into each co-op experience and give an honest take on each one.
