I'm now a third year student at Waterloo. Even though I'm 2A, I still have the knowledge retained from being so old. Here's a couple things I wish I knew in the first two years of my undergrad.

## Co-op later is usually better

4,8, and 12 stream are possible options. That being said, I think 12 stream is by far the best, with 8 second and then 4. The problem is that a lot of people struggle to find a good first co-op. I did, and in the long run, every co-op counts and builds a foundation for getting the next one.

Going in and finding a co-op job without experience or much university course experience is tough. Especially transitioning into university to high school in the first 4 months is tough.
