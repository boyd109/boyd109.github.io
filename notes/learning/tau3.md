## Side Projects?
I think side projects are one of the most misunderstood and overrated aspects of job searching. I asked people what they thought was the key to being successful and tons said side projects. There is no obvious correlation from side projects to job offers, but it's widely believed to be a causative relationship.

I initially was a huge believer of doing side projects and success will pave way, but I've recently changed my stance for multiple reasons.

1. Quality of side projects
2. Bots filtering through resumes
3. Side projects are usually small compared to work experience

## 1 Quality
I hate it when people use school assignments as side projects. I also dislike it when people put hackathon projects that they did little to no work on but it won/was an impressive project. The basis for this is that the motivation is not behind the side project. It is literally there to hook an interview.

The school assignments as a side project have little to no motivation. You literally had to make that for a school assessment and if you didn't you would fail. That means in CS135, the whole class has a sudoku solver (I never took cs135, but so I've heard) and in CS246, everyone has a chess game or some alternative in C++. The school assignments not only are contiguous to the other students, but in my opinion is just lazy placement for side projects. Of course if you have absolutely nothing, you have to put something, but I think you should at least try things to MAKE a side project, rather than port over what you already made "because you had to".

## 2 Bots
I have yet to know of a recruitment bot that can assess quality of side projects. Most employers so swamped they can't do it. As a result, the side projects will go under-appreciated.



## 3 Side project vs work experience

There is no doubt that work experience is valuable. What Waterloo's co-op program prides itself on is giving work experience to students to help be more employable in the future.
