## Side Projects?
I think side projects are one of the most misunderstood and overrated aspects of job searching. I asked people what they thought was the key to being successful and tons said side projects. There is no obvious correlation from side projects to job offers, but it's widely believed to be a causative relationship.

I initially was a huge believer of doing side projects and success will pave way, but I've recently changed my stance for multiple reasons.

1. Quality of side projects
2. Bots filtering through resumes
3. Side projects are usually small compared to work experience
