In doing research for this blog post I wanted to compile the most influential blog posts and sites that I read when I was in undergrad. Luckily enough I found a github repo listing a lot of ones that I had seen previously or had yet to discover: https://github.com/rudi-c/the-waterloo-blogger. Most are from Waterloo, but some are just general tech/life posts.

Especially in first and second year I enjoyed reading blog posts (that were not too technical for me to understand) and ones that gave a glimpse into upper-year life at Waterloo. Here's a collection that I've read.
