## Sometimes first time is the charm
It's hard to believe ETHWaterloo is the first iteration of the hackathon series. The event was amazingly funded, great sponsors, good food, good venue, and barely any hiccups. The reasoning behind the smooth event? Most of the team already ran Hack the North. The 300 person hackathon is almost 1/4 of the size of Hack the North, which allows for a more focused and quality based hackathon.

## The What: ETHWaterloo
ETHWaterloo is the largest Ethereum hackathon in the world. Inviting 300 of the brightest Ethereum developers and people knowledgeable in the space. Over 2000 people applied, making this on par with Hack the North's ridiculous 1/7 acceptance rate.

This was not an MLH event, and was fairly small by comparison. It was held at the CIGI in uptown Waterloo. The only rules were that the hack must be related to Ethereum blockchain. The event had no age limits (unlike most hackathons), so it was filled with software engineers, people who are experts in the space, and regular university students as well.

## Opening and Closing Ceremonies
Opening ceremonies most notably had a talk from Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethreum and UWaterloo drop-out. It is hard to describe him as a drop-out since Peter Thiel gave him $100,000 to start Ethereum if he dropped out. They were short (1-2 hours) and didn't drag on too long.

Closing ceremonies had some demos and some speakers. Short, concise, done. Not too long.

## Sponsors
The judge list was stellar and the sponsors were huge. Major tokens and smaller startups were there. Coinbase, 0x, storj, Ethereum Foundation, Consensys, the list goes on. The big names wanted to see what the attendees could create.

## Food and snacks
It was insane. Tons of food and snacks. The sandwiches for breakfast were probably the worst, but last meal Bao House? BEST MEAL. Just like Hack the North.

## Final Verdict
I can't stress how well ran this event was. I will ignore small hiccups like opening ceremonies starting 30 minutes late, etc. It was like Hack the North, but more VIP and had a greater focus on the quality of the event rather than policing the 1200 people. Vitalik coming is huge, huge ethereum companies, pretty good prizes, amazing food, etc. Probably my favourite hackathon of the term so far, and maybe \#2 of all time behind Mhacks9. Extremely well run, and sets a new standard for hackathons in Canada.
