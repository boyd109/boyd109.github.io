This is a bit of a relic, but I think it'd be nice to discuss what the Jobmine glitch was. The Jobmine glitch was a Jobmine exclusive glitch (not in WaterlooWorks) that allowed students to see which employers gave them an offer BEFORE the released date for that term. This was important because sometimes people would have to wait almost a month before rankings came out, and a lot of employers "ranked" students before then. (If you are unfamiliar with Waterloo's ranking procedure see [this](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/get-hired/ranking-matching#Ranking))

If this is so old people don't even know what Jobmine is, Jobmine is the co-op website Waterloo used to use before WaterlooWorks.

## Jobmine Glitch

In short it is:

Active Applications + Applications Available in Job Inquiry - 50 = Offers or Other Statuses
This was confirmed to work from multiple people.

## Jobmine Glitch Steps

1. Get some interviews. This is varying difficulty. This glitch is for figuring out which companies have given you an offer. Unfortunately (and fortunately) it doesn't GIVE you interviews.
2. Do well enough in some interviews to get offers. This glitch only tells you which companies gave you an offer before ranking deadline. If you have tons of interviews but no offers, this glitch doesn't really work. (Well it will tell you no one gave you an offer, but that is clear from your Active Applications + Applications Available in Job Inquiry - 50 = 50 still, meaning no one gave an offer.)
3. Sort your active apps by App and then status

4. Sort by App and then Status again, reversing the order. Repeat it a few times and look at the order of the ranked jobs

5. You should be able to see that the jobs did not reverse perfectly, and some jobs "hug" the edge of the applied jobs column

Tree_Boar explains that "You'll note that the jobs did not perfectly reverse. In our example, Infusion and Arcelor Mittal are the closest to the "applied" jobs, the other 4 remain on the other side, no matter how many times you repeat this."


> "This is because even if the value is hidden until we get rankings, the jobs are actually still ranked alphabetically in that column: the possibilities are "Offer" and "Ranked." Since Offer is closer alphabetically to Applied, jobs for which we have an offer will always be on that side of those for which we have a rank."

I was unfortunately only able to use the Jobmine glitch once, since they switched to WaterlooWorks immediately after my 2nd coop. That being said, because of these hidden values, you could tell if you got an offer before the ranking date. Even more unfortunate is that this is gone in WaterlooWorks, but enjoy this little relic from Waterloo.
