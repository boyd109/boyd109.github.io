I attended MhackX from September 22-24, 2017. After attending 13 hackathons (of varying sizes) and winning none of them something miraculous happened. I won two api prizes at the event. It's like Cleveland's sports drought, but it was my drought that was finally fulfilled. Here's my breakdown of the event objectively without thinking about actually winning.

## Venue
UMichigan north campus is very nice. The EECS and engineering buildings are spacious, usually cleanly, and are nice to explore. The washrooms and some trash bins at times can be overflowing and/or some ammenities needing fixing urgently, but the place is nice. The sponsors aren't crammed in a small area (\*cough Hack the North \*cough). I like the arrangement in EECS and the desks have charging plugs for the most part.

9/10

## Food and snacks and I guess swag
This was the most confusing part of the event for me. Sponsors hoarded swag and then at random times unleashed a mob of people to grab everything they can. Hats, pillows, shirts, fidgt cubes, wings, snacks, etc. I'm not against free stuff, but people described getting a Youtube Pillow like a giant mob on Black Friday. I unfortunately didn't run fast enough to get one. Why are we all running for this stuff, I thought hackathons were for coding. I may be tired of swag after going to a lot of hackathons, but I love getting free stuff like the next person. I'm not going to run and knock people over for a t-shirt or beanie.

That being said, food was decent for a US hackathon (ain't no Qhacks), snacks were scarce until the last day where they said 'FFA', in Call of Duty terms free-for-all and grab as much as you want. The snacks were okay I guess, no caffeinated cookies, and just standard stuff like fruit gummies, awake chocolate, vitamin water, etc.

Food 8/10
Snacks 6/10
Swag 8/10
People's behaviour around swag 2/10

## Events
I didn't go to any, so I can't exactly comment. I was working on my project.

## Opening and Closing Ceremonies
That was the 2nd worst opening ceremonies I had ever been to. The grove. (Grove street CJ). The whole event revolved around the grove, which was a flat area surrounding a bell tower on UMichigan campus. It must have seemed like a good idea to relocate the ceremonies on-campus to avoid chartering busses to central campus, avoid fees from the hotel, etc. In practice, it didn't pan out too well. They had no projector for showing demos, no sponsor pitch decks could be seen, and the microphone was pretty weak. On top of that, most people threw swag (albeit leftover MHacks 8 shirts and palantir shirt leftovers) to the first 2 rows of people.

4/10?

## Problems
I hate security at hackathons. That can be interpreted in two ways. I hate Hack the North where I get screened when walking into the building. It makes me feel like I am entering some prestigious area or I am being profiled for going in. It also allows for non-hackers to stay out. When you have UMichigan students taking all the food, and when I finish demoing I get nothing that kinda sucks. That happened to me on the last day. It did suck. I didn't get much food. This only happened for one meal, but I felt kind of cheesed.

## Overall
MHacksX is solid, but MHacks 9 was better than MHacksX. The logo, snacks, etc. That being said I still love the series, and I will gladly go to MHacks 11. I'll say this again about MHacks, they aren't always perfect (MHacks 8 venue), they make mistakes (MHacks10 grove), but they innovate and I can respect that. If a hackathon only strives to be the same, it gets boring. When you change it up and constantly try to see what works and what sucks, that works in the long run. Thank you MHacks for another amazing hackathon.
