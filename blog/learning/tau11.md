I was astonished when I won my first hackathon. Tons of my other friends had done it, but I was the perennial non-winner. What does it take to win a hackathon? What does winning even mean? I can't say I'm an expert at answering those questions, but I do know some things since I went to 14 hackathons in total now.

### Quick Facts  
1. the best hacks don't always win  
2. the most technical hacks don't always win  
3. the best ideas don't always win  
4. the best pitches don't always win  

Why is this so? Because each one has a fatal flaw.

1. 'best hack' is personally subjective, but if you can't explain that to the judges, your best hack is not the best to them. You have to convey your idea to the judges. And the judges aren't always technical.
2. Being technical is an asset. But if your asset is technical but lacks a use case or lacks a practical pitch, it may be forgotten. This is an unforgiving part from smart teams. You can make an amazing product, but if it is too beyond, people can't appreciate the greatness.
3. Ideas are ideas and just that. If you can't execute on it, you have an untangible project. I have heard of times when pitches of ideas won hackathons, but I won't argue with the feasibility of that happening. Just don't expect it to work at every hackathon.
4. This is similar to \#3. You can pitch well, but if they ask for a live demo or testing it out, that's not going to necessarily work.

### What does it take to win a hackathon?
Winning a hackathon is easy for some, and hard for some. Before I won at MHacksX, people told me winning a hackathon was easy and I was just bad. Brushing that aside, it eventually happened. If I had any words of advice for people wanting to win a hackathon, its persevere and go at every opportunity you can.

### Easier Hackathons
The easiest hackathons to win are local ones. The talent is smaller, smaller entrants, everything is smaller. When you have a situation in the US where 1000+ people show up, you expect a level of talent and execution from projects. If you really want to win a hackathon, you could try smaller hackathons where you are pitted against 20 teams or so. I won't call it immediately a walk in the park, but it is easier to a degree. One of my friends told me that a prize for a local one was $75, but then you go to MHacksX and it was $100 for best use of Wolfram API, and that's not even 1st place. Some of the allure of the large ones are the ridiculous prizes, and with that comes competition. If you want to win one just in title, I'd try a local hackathon.

### Makeup of a Successful Hackathon Run
My breakup of success at a hackathon:  
40% idea  
30% execution (which includes team)  
30% luck  

This is super subjective, but I truly think a good idea implemented simply can beat complex ideas that are either not useful or presented poorly. When you make something that is not creative or it has been replicated or seen before in many facets, people are bored. I saw so many OpenCV projects at MHacksX. If you can create something new and interesting, people get excited. I think 70% of the hackathon run is controlled by you, but still 30% comes down to the luck. What did other teams make? Did they crumble and not submit? Did they forget to submit for that category on Devpost? All of those are legitimate things that happen on a regular basis. Stick to controlling what you can control. Make a cool idea, even if it is simple. Execute on it and market it as a useful creation. Pitches are important.

#### Team Formation
I don't think solo teams can win easily. It's doable, but I wouldn't recommend it. I think there is a sweet spot for teams of 2-3, and only teams of 4 can be extremely successful if they are a 'Super Team'. Why you want a team is because it instantly makes you accountable for the teams' actions and success. You need to figure out team strengths and weaknesses and be able to play off that. Hackathons are much more than coding. If you can't work in a team or work is not delegated correctly (as it usually is), teams have lopsided structures, crumble under pressure, and don't function in the most efficient manner. This is probably why a lot of people don't enjoy hackathons or they criticize the "coding" aspect of it. It is more than just making a project, it is working in a team and how to make things in a group.

### Why I Team Form/Blueprint
Team formation events or blueprinting, or just finding random people at the event. It is literally a mixed bag. But a mixed bag is an asset and not a negative. I contemplated finding a static team for hackathons after I couldn't win any. I thought I was good enough to win, and that I was surrounded by subpar talent.

This was far from it. If anything the people I met at team-building seminars were amazing for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it opens you to meeting new people you probably would have never met. Some people travel from across the world and come from various universities and programs. That diverse skill set makes it so teams are well-rounded. Secondly, these people are already team-orientated. By opening themselves to working in a team, they are showing willingness to learn and work at the hackathon. You want people to be on the team that are like that. Thirdly, it's good to just code with people. If you go with your friends to hackathons you tend to be sheltered and not meet anyone new. There is a new world out there, and you can travel to meet new people. (Yes, the third point is similar to the first one, but it is so crucial)

#### Super Teams
I don't like super teams for the fact that they are 'super teams'. That being said, super teams don't always win. That is what is beautiful about hackathons. That 30% randomness keeps some perennial winners from actually being perennial winners. I was only introduced to the idea of professionally designed super teams at PennApps, and before that I only knew friend groups who were literally super teams. When you have insane amounts of cash prizes, coordination is probably the next step. That being said, it is isn't impossible for underdogs to win, and cool ideas usually win, not necessarily technical ability.

#### Pitch
Pitches win projects. Or something. Being a two-way player is where you can code and present. I wasn't really that way all the time, and I certainly can't code to some people levels still. But if you can present well, you are an asset.

That's the unsung hero of expos. Pitches show the judges why your creation is awesome and why you deserve a prize. I don't even think [Investera](https://devpost.com/software/investera) is the most insanely technical project ever, but it was marketed correctly, it was simple to understand, and we pitched it in that way. I pitched to most of the judges at MHacksX, and I guess they liked it enough to win best use of Wolfram API and MixMax API. That's the power of a pitch for a product.

### What does winning a hackathon mean?
It means whatever you want it to mean. You obviously get a sweet prize, but there is more to it. You get some recognition sure. I like to see that after these 14 hackathons I grew as a hacker. I can lead a team and I can code. I can present the project and I can be a viable contender. I was almost like a role-player or sixth man on most teams before. (This means that I played a small role in the team) Now I feel like I can truly achieve anything I put my mind to and it was a validation of all the hard work I put in. If you are in a similar situation, go to 13 hackathons.

Fail hard. And one time the hard work will pay off. It was hard for me to see but I can see it now. Even I'm not in the clear yet, but I am proud of making it this far and I look forward to continuing. Someone asked me if I would quit hackathons now that I won one, and I said "Why quit now? I can do so much more."

## Winning
I never knew when I would win at a hackathon. Scratch that. I never thought I would win a hackathon. I waited so long I never knew when it would actually come true. It's unreal. It's two API prizes, but next I'm coming for top 3. Thank you MHacksX and thank you to my teammates that I found at team-building. I was so close to skipping MHacksX and working on my CS370 assignment and I almost had no team after the team-building session. Then we walk out with two API prizes. That's a comeback. But it's only the start.
