Switching into CS was by no means a quick or easy process. It took me almost two years from the inception that I wanted to switch into it back in Fall 2015 and it was official on my Quest transcript in Spring 2017. I switched into Computer Science before the new guidelines take effect in Fall 2017. In the past it was quoted that it was fairly simple to switch in  [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/61aso0/what_the_hell_is_going_on_with_upper_year_cs/). So here's some information on why I switched and what I did to switch into CS.

I didn't actually go into university with the plan to switch into computer science, since I joined as a "Science and Business" student in the science faculty, and I had never taken computer science in high school.

## The process
There was a very loose process with very subjective guidelines. This surprised me, I thought there would be difficult boundaries on marks and averages, but when I talked to co-op advisors, math advisors, internal transfer advisors, they had answers, but didn't really have extremely strict guidelines for switching. Yes, you need two strong math marks and strong cs marks. But even strong is subjective and changes from cs course to cs course.

Some things I did very regularly were:
1. Talk to math academic advisors (when I was still in science) and the internal transfer faculty member
2. Take courses to enable me to switch (math 135, math 135, cs 136, etc.) before I applied to transfer.


## Even if you don't meet the requirements, you can still switch if you work hard
They told me I needed strong CS course marks, meaning 80+ in CS 115/116. Unfortunately in 2014, I got 75 in CS 115, and I thought it was over. They said it wasn't (fortunately) and I got an 87 in CS 116. Then in CS 136 I got 92, therefore solidifying the "strong CS course marks", and I was able to directly switch from Science and Business to CS without going in the intermediary step of Math Faculty honours general math in Spring 2017. (To be fair this is technically not entirely true. I transferred while I was on co-op, and I was in the math faculty general math for a few weeks before the transfer to computer science. I applied for computer science so I was technically stuck in between for a few weeks while the decision was updated fully.)

I took CS 115 in fall 2014, my first term on campus, and I didn't actually enjoy it enough to take CS 116 at the time. What really motivated me to switch to CS was

1. My first hackathon, TerribleHack 2
2. My first co-op, where admittedly I didn't code, but I learned about the possibilities of coding.
3. I didn't love science labs
4. Computer Science seemed interesting.


## 1 TerribleHack 2
This hackathon had a more profound effect on me that it was apparent to even myself at the time. I was in the process of learning python, and me and my friend presented a project there. It had a fairly lukewarm response despite it being a joke hackathon. What amazed me were the other presentations that showed what people were capable of making.

## 2 Intrafinity
My first co-op I was exposed to the nature of computer science and technology. The work I did was not remotely close to coding, but it made me inquire on my tastes and interest in computer science. It was like a wild unknown and it fascinated me that it could be used to solve practical problems. So much of our lives had relied on a website, an api call, a graphical interface, apps, all build upon programming.

## 3 Science
The science faculty wasn't the best fit for me. I liked the math faculty (and the advisors in math are amazing), the events, the people all felt more like home. Also, all my friends from my first co-op and really in general were in the math faculty.

## 4 Future of Computer Science
As I said above, computer science is fascinatingly powerful. It lies on powerful concepts that I had no idea about at the time. It was a blind jump into cs, but it was interesting to me, I enjoyed it, and I felt like there are few times in life when you can drop everything and pursue something new and mysterious. It paid off, because I am immensely happy with the switch, and it may be the best decision I ever made.
