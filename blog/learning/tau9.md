I attended Hack the North for the first time. I had been rejected in 2016 and 2015, and I was happy to get a chance to attend the coveted hackathon. It is a little more special since I am from Waterloo, and it is in my backyard and I know the area.

Contrary to a previous post, I was very set on going to HackMIT, but I decided against it, and I just attended Hack the North 2017.

### Venue
It's held in E5 and E6. They are very nice and spacious buildings. I like the area and it highlights probably the best areas of campus. There is copious amount of space, and it has good facilities.

8/10

### Sponsors and Swag
Unusually good/a lot of swag. Another positive is that the companies had a lot of lightning challenges where you are given a question and you need to solve it in a certain amount of time. I did a lightning challenge for LoyaltyOne and did a "swag challenge" for Square. They were pretty fun. I've been to a few hackathons, but I haven't seen companies challenges, or maybe even to this scale. It's impressive.

### Hacking and Events
Opening ceremonies had Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

They had a cryptocurrency panel.

There are tons of API prizes, prizes, etc. The hacking was average in comparison to American hackathons, and the prizes were plentiful.

### Food and snacks
The food was decent at best, but the snacks were good. You could tell that the budget in snacks was good, it was never empty. I'm biased but I didn't like the portions of the Aunty's Kitchen food or the pasta on the first day, but at least it isn't qHacks. (qHacks literally gave half a Costco catered sandwich and half a Subway sandwich. HALF) The food is almost entirely improved by the Bao Sandwich Bar. That food is so expensive at their store, but so incredible to eat. It's crazy. They gave you two $4 baos for lunch, or one banh mi. This stuff was free, and I ended up eating 4 baos (2 bulgogi, 1 pulled pork, 1 chicken). I can't get over how good those baos are. Bao Bar is arguably the best food in Waterloo.

### Other Notes

Wow, this hackathon ranks highly! Well there are some non-normal factors that made me feel a bit uneasy with the hackathon.

### Velocity Residence People
Normally people attending the velocity residence in the fall term are able to go to Hack the North 2017 without applying. I applied to be safe, and luckily I did that. Apparently this was a grey area rule that was miscommunicated. When the majority of the residence showed up they were denied entrance. This is probably a group of 30 people who are hackers/coders/entrepreneurs. These aren't any random people who are trying to walk in.

To play devil's advocate, the miscommunication is a fault on both sides, and I do acknowledge the fire code and capacity requirements. That being said, I would think that 30 bright individuals would bolster the hackathon talent...not make it more gluttonous. I see the organizers' viewpoints, but I still think they should acknowledge their "promise" because their excuse for not letting those people in was that they didn't apply, and they said if they applied, then they would get accepted "automatically". It led to me being very let down by the entire staff of HTN and Velocity staff as well. I was planning on teaming with three people from the residence and since I missed team formation, I hacked alone. I'm not giving this a score, but I am deeply disappointed in how this was handled from both parties.

### Judges and the pursuit of Knowledge
This is more of an opinion, but I feel hackathons are a learning ground. Some communicate this better than otherh When I went in to present my hack, a fairly simple to-do list that didn't work, I knew it wasn't great. But I like presenting and I want to show what I made regardless of the quality. When I was attempting to set up (and in the end the cable didn't work), and I overheard the judges talk about how the first few pitches have been terrible. I was the fourth presentation of the day for them and I knew I had a bad product. There's two major things I had on my mind:

1. Regardless if the groups were terrible, I don't think it's in line to murmur that while students are there. The message of hackathons are to make them accessible to newcomers, but on multiple occasions I've felt the pressure of not being good enough. By that I mean when you make a "learning project", and people hate on it to a similar degree as a prize-contending project. There is no official "learning project" criteria, but I feel in most cases when you see one, you can notice it. I'm not saying you shouldn't offer valid criticism, but you shouldn't rip on it to the same degree as a polished project. This is because the creator(s) and hopefully the judges should acknowledge it is a "learning project", and giving valid criticism that does not depress the creator(s) is how to help them grow.

2. What is a good project? What is a "learning project"? It's not clear cut. Think about that for a moment.

I presented my faulty to-do list that couldn't even delete to-do items and had no front-end. Now if you tell me my front-end sucks, or I suck because my to-do items can't be deleted, is it trivial that I don't know this already? I value criticism that looks past this. Maybe you can suggest alternatives, front-end options, I find that great. It shows you look past a bad product, and really value the learning of the individual over the product created.

I also find this disappointing because among the three judges in the room at the time, I really idolized one of them. I loved their life story, their speech. I was very disappointed with the conduct I heard from them.

### Closing Ceremonies HTN staff grabs me
I'm sitting in the closing ceremonies and a named HTN organizer asks if my seat is reserved for "media" and "staff". I had seen before it wasn't, but he asks me to get up so we can see. If it is, there should be a piece of paper underneath the chair. To my surprise this person, not a volunteer but a key member of the organizing team, grabs my arm and literally pulls me out of the chair. I was getting out of the seat at the time, and I was not going particularly slow. When I stood up he stood there and reaffirmed that it was fine for me to sit there. I was profusely confused for this notion and I didn't appreciate it.

### Overall
It was a good hackathon that had some weak points and pretentious behaviour at different facets. I'll probably give it a 7 or 6 out of 10, but my approval and opinion of Hack the North, and Techyon are severely lower (and Velocity staff but to a lesser degree). The hackathon was fine or good in many aspects, but why am I getting grabbed by staff, or why do they block people who were essentially "promised" in? I want to try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm just confused by the decisions they made.
