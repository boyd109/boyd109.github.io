## I love hackathons
I really enjoy hackathons. I've tried to go to as many as I can because I view it as an experience to be able to code, meet new people, and travel for a weekend. (and is free) There's not many instances when you can say you do that for a weekend, especially as a student. What I didn't realize when I first applied to hackathons is the sheer interest and difficulty of getting into some hackathons.

Notorious Hackathons:
- UofTHacks
- HackTheNorth

From my experience the two most notorious hackathons are UofTHacks and HackTheNorth. I got rejected from both of these for 2 years, and only got accepted in the most recent attempts.

Even now I am still getting tons of rejections.

HackTheNorth 2017, HackMIT, and BigRedHacks are all happening on September 15-17 weekend, and I applied to all three. Theoretically, I can only attend one of them, but I was fairly sure I wasn't going to get into all three. I only got into HackTheNorth.

HackTheNorth (Accepted)  
BigRedHacks (Waitlist or Rejected)  
HackMIT (Waitlist or Rejected)  

I'm amazed I got into HackTheNorth because I've been rejected twice, it is an insanely hard hackathon to get into (6000 applications, 1000 spots) and even when I asked my friends about 6 were rejected, and 2 were accepted. 2/6 = 1/3 which is technically better than the 1/6 stat, but those are slim odds.

## How do you get accepted to hackathons?
There are a few things I wish I knew when I first applied to hackathons to help my marketability. I got straight rejected from every hackathon I applied to for about a year and a half. The first hackathon (that had a acceptance process) that I got accepted to was MHacks 8. Not only was that a legendary experience, but they really took a chance and accepted me.

I think that hackathon acceptance hinges on 3 major categories
1. Experience/Inexperience
2. Writing
3. Luck

NOTE: I don't know the exact acceptance terms, and they obviously vary from hackathon to hackathon, so this is large conjecture.

## Experience/Inexperience
I like to describe hackathons attendees that get accepted are fit into buckets. Large hackathons look at three major "hacker" categories. There are the new hackers, or people new to hackathons, there are the medium hackers, who have been to a few, and the experienced hackers, who have won hackathons or are just insane (IOI, Google, that stuff)

Buckets:  
New hackers  
Medium hackers  
Experienced hackers  

If you can't fit neatly into a noob, or are between medium and experienced, then you don't necessarily fit into the perfect archetype. Why accept a guy who has been to a lot of hackathons, but hasn't created anything, versus a new hacker? When you go to some hackathons and you have no results, you are slotted into the position under medium, but above new hacker since you have been to a few hackathons.
I view hackathons aim to accept 40% new people, 40% medium, and 20% experienced. (These numbers can vary depending on the skill of attendees the organizers want)

## Writing
This is like when you applied to universities in high school. You write an essay saying why you love the program and what you do outside of school to supplement the 99% average you have.

Humans usually read your applications. (Unless it is HackMIT and their lottery...) Write something compelling, and spend some time drafting something sensational that will help you get accepted and stand out. This seems like a logical thing to do, but it emphasizes why they should accept you and why you should be able to travel for free to the event. You are receiving free perks from the event, and the organizers want you to hack and give back in a similar way.

## Luck
The factor that is most out of our reach. Like I said with HackMIT, there lottery system which is (entirely?) luck based. I am still slightly salty that I didn't get accepted. You can't control this and a lot of times you just have to be lucky. I attest my HackTheNorth acceptance to luck.

## What do you do if you don't get accepted.
It sucks to not be accepted. It makes it worse when the event is as coveted as HackTheNorth, or equivalent. If you are very passionate about attending and want to go, I would say just go on the bus and hope you can walk-in. When I was at QHacks I got accepted but forgot to RSVP, but they still let me walk on. When I was at HackPrinceton, I got rejected, but I went on the bus and took it to Princeton. Granted, HackPrinceton wasn't too happy that I took the bus there, but they couldn't turn me back after the 8 hour bus ride. If you truly want something, you'll find a way to do it.

I'll see you at HackMIT. ;)
