I'm now a third year student at Waterloo. Even though I'm in 2A CS, I still have the knowledge retained from being so old. Here's a couple things I wish I knew in the first two years of my undergrad.

## Co-op is not 90% employment rate

The economic definition of 'unemployed' is someone who is not working, but **is actively searching for employment**. By this definition some people can't find jobs in Jobmine/WaterlooWorks. The reasoning is a lot of factors (faculty, market demand, skills, etc.)

How the "Cooperative Education & Career Action" or CECA keeps employment rates so high?

[From their site](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/why-co-op/employment-statistics)
```
Not every co-op student finds a job
The co-op program does not guarantee you employment. Historically, our overall employment rates have varied between 86-99.9 per cent.
```

You may not find employment for your co-op work term. The majority of unemployed students each term tend to be at the junior level, looking for a first or second work term.

The 86-99.9% is maintained by removing people who have not found a co-op twice. At that point, you are removed from the co-op program. This means you aren't **actively searching for employment**, and therefore limits the amount of people who can't find co-ops from the co-op statistic.

This is a fair method of calculation, but it does fairly skew the results for hopeful people. The world of co-op is harder than it may seem.

## 12 Stream better than 8 Stream better than 16 Stream, 4 Stream

If you are unfamiliar with the waterloo co-op streams, there are a bunch of streams you choose when coming here and it determines when you go on co-op.

**Fall:** September - December  
**Winter:** January - April  
**Spring:** May - August  

**4 stream:** You start in September, and go on co-op in winter. This means you look for co-op in the SAME term you join Waterloo.

**8 stream:** You start in September, and go on co-op in spring. This means you have one school term, then look for co-op in winter (alongside being in school). Math has two variations of this in SEQ1 and SEQ2. They are pretty similar and I'll treat them as the same.

**12 stream:** You start in September, and go on co-op in fall. This means you have two school terms, then look for co-op in spring (alongside being in school)

**16 stream:** You start in September, and go on co-op in winter (of NEXT NEXT year). You go two school terms, then have summer off, and go back to school in fall. This means you have three school terms, then look for co-op in winter (alongside being in school)

**Example of 16 stream:**
Join in fall 2014, school winter 2015, off spring 2015, school fall 2015. co-op winter 2016

I tried to simplify it as best as I could, here is a [full link](https://uwaterloo.ca/new-math-students/co-op-students/co-op-sequence-charts)

For most faculties it differs, engineers have these streams, and math it has some of them, but under different names.

4, 8, 12, and 16 stream are possible options for co-op. That being said, I think 12 stream is by far the best, then 8 and then 4 and 16. The problem is that a lot of people struggle to find a good first co-op. I did, and in the long run, every co-op counts and builds a foundation for getting the next one.

The reason why I don't like 16 stream is that you graduate a term later and the reasoning is that you get the summer off. In science I did that, and I felt that you really didn't need the summer off. You can go into school with courses and such and be fine.

Going in and finding a co-op job without experience or much university course experience is tough. Especially transitioning into university to high school in the first 4 months is tough. Some people have found it easy, but from my experience and some others, it has been fairly challenging. In math there is no "4 stream", so you don't even need to worry about it.

The 12 stream (School in Fall->Winter->Spring->Co-op) in first year has multiple benefits in my opinion:
- have done more academically before co-op
- have time to adjust and experience Waterloo
- experience spring term in Waterloo (which is nice)

The most valuable of those, to me is the first one. Being farther ahead academically is a huge plus. For CS specifically if you are in 8-stream, you look for co-op only taken intro to CS or some intro level courses. If you are in 12-stream, you have taken CS135 and CS136 (or alternatively CS115 and CS116)
This means that you can show:

CS 115/CS116
Introduction to Computer Science 1 and 2

or

CS135/CS136:
Designing Functional Programs and Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction

This is fairly petty if you have real world experience or side projects, but when applying to be in 2A and some courses under your belt, it looks more favourable from an employer's standpoint.

## Co-op hierarchy

Within tech there is a pseudo hierarchy for co-op positions, ranging in the amount of coding done in the job.

Engineer better than Developer better than QA better than IT better than Non-technical

The most coding is usually done in engineer and least is IT and non-technical jobs. It is arguable that finding a non-technical job is harder than getting an IT or QA position. It is also usually the most difficult to get an engineer or Developer position because they ask a coding question, compared to QA or IT which are usually behavioural questions.

That being said, if you love IT or QA, go for it. I found that this hierarchy mainly applies to the **difficulty** of getting the jobs (generally) not necessarily what you should always aim for. In a sense, if you are a lower-year student that needs some form of co-op, you may look for a co-op position in QA or IT because it is easier to get, and if you want to code and are an upper year, you can usually attain the engineer or dev jobs just from experience, seniority, etc.
