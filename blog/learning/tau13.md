## The Reality
People like to bolster the Waterloo Toronto pathway as some mystical entrepreneurial hotbed of Canada. I've never been to Silicon Valley or California (at least in depth on a work term). You can argue that it's the closest thing Canada's got, possibly downtown Toronto pulling comparisons to NYC at 1/10 the size. Sadly, it is far from the truth. There is a reason Canada, and notably Toronto and Waterloo are experiencing "brain drain" (where educated minds leave places) to go to USA. The conversion of Waterloo students to California is a one sided street. No one from California or even USA EVER travels to Waterloo and (usually) Toronto to work here for prospects.
