Despite the fact that I'm in Computer Science at Waterloo, I think you should not get too tunnel visioned into thinking it is the only option, or that Waterloo is even the only university in the world. I think there are a ton of great options I didn't realize as a high school student.


## Software Engineering at Waterloo
This is somewhat cheating since people love to love this program as well.


## CS and Business Double Degree at Waterloo and Laurier
This is slightly cheating as well, maybe even moreso than SE. I like business, so if I had a chance to reapply, I would definetly apply to this as well. I would assume it is comparable difficulty of getting in since it has CS and Laurier. This is basically CS at Waterloo and Business degree at Laurier, the best of both campuses. It is to be warned I've heard this program's difficulty is brutal.

**NOTE:** When applying to this, you can choose your "host" school either Waterloo or Laurier by applying to either one respectively. I'd recommend Waterloo on the basis that you get to use WaterlooWorks over Laurier's co-op search program. I have no first hand experience, but since Waterloo's co-op program is has matured more with age than Laurier's, that's my take.

## Computing and Financial Management at Waterloo
Another program technically under the CS branch.

## Data Science
This is a new program based on the rise of machine learning, AI, etc. I don't know too much about it, but it is definitely up and coming, has tons of relevant CS courses that make it still CS-based, and seems pretty cool. I can't comment too much on it, but as a major it seems legit.

Someone told me this is more of a mix between stats and cs major.

## General Math at Waterloo, then picking something
This may get some flack, but hear me on this. Waterloo is the only math faculty in Canada (? I looked for sources but could not find any) I think the faculty, advisors, and events are great. I feel it is a more vivid community that science, with a plethora of events and things to get involved in, granted you reach out to them. I think just being in math faculty is a nice thing, and then choosing the major from within it.

[mathSoc Clubs](http://mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca/clubs)
Other clubs (Not even exclusive to math faculty members): mathNews, Board Game Night, CS Club, etc.

That being said, choosing a specific major in math might be beneficial from any on the list. They vary in difficulty, breadth, and variety.  [list](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/majors-minors-and-specializations)


## Computer Engineering
Finally something that isn't a program that is technically under the CS branch.



## Systems Design Engineering
I don't know too much about this program, and when speaking to people in it, some of them have trouble explaining what this program is! (I kid, I kid) This engineering program combines a lot of the other engineering programs and is a mixture of all of them in some way. (from what I've heard)


The list doesn't end here. There are tons of great programs I don't know too much about, or that are really hidden gems. University is about finding out what you enjoy, and being able to graduate learned things and ready for the workforce. Waterloo does that in their own way, and other universities do that in a different way. Waterloo is not the only university in the world, and if you don't get in, it's not the end of the world either.

## Any program, but getting involved and being passionate
Hey now this is a real cop-out. You can't just say any program is fine and dandy? Well I do believe it is possible.

Desmond Choi was an arts from Waterloo. He founded Sparkgig and MappedIn and was at the Communitech for a while.

[Kaustav Haldar](http://kaustavha.github.io/resume/3/)
Hopefully Costco won't mind if I plug his resume here. (I don't expect too many people to read this anyways) He was originally in management engineering, learned coding his way and found success. He changed majors to Psychology, but that is to round out machine learning and AI that is up and coming. He's extremely talented, and a great example that majors don't define you.
