Co-op is great for many reasons. The work experience allows grads to look for jobs with previous work experience and it allows people to find out what they enjoy doing in the workplace. It also (because I assume this is not exclusive to Waterloo co-op) has a ton of garbage co-op jobs, or cheap labour. It's also divisive and not suited for every person.

## Positives

- work experience (that varies in quality)
- payment
- experience different jobs but not being too committed

## Negatives

- slows down graduation, when considering grad school, masters, etc.
- no break like traditional fall-winter schools
- detriment in a lot of programs (Environment, science, arts sometimes)
- co-op fee every term
- PD and work reports
