**note:** A bit frustrating but I wrote this entire thing then deleted it without committing it. So I wrote this twice.
**note2:** These are my thoughts only.

My inspiration is Eric Jang's post talking about his internships [here](https://blog.evjang.com/2016/06/my-internship-experiences-at-pixar.html).

Waterloo's co-op program allows you to do 6 co-op experiences at (usually) different companies. I really enjoy this aspect because it lets you experience different companies, teams, tech stacks, and more. Switching into CS from Science I was granted 5 co-op terms from the co-op office. I asked the co-op office if I could do 6 co-ops. They said no. I asked if I paid the co-op fee the requisite number of times could I do 6 co-ops. They said no. I asked why I couldn't get 6 co-ops and the unsatisfactory answer was that since I switched in at around 2A and I had spent the summer off in the science faculty (built into my sequence back in science) they did not let me get 6 co-ops. Nonetheless I took an off-term to do my 6th co-op and I actually graduated that term as well. (which would not have been possible had it been an official co-op term, since you need to end on an academic term)

In a more concise manner than [My-Story](https://jonathantsang.github.io/my-story) I want to delve into each co-op experience and give an honest take on each one. There is a lot to discuss in each one, as I grew as a software engineer, and what I liked/didn't like.

Gonna look at things like:
- Perks
- Work
- Culture

### Co-op 1: SchoolMessenger (Winter 2016)

This was my first co-op as a Web Analyst. Not much to say since the Jobmine posting had requirements of "2A and above, Canadian citizen" as the requirements. They paid me $13/hr to copy and paste content from one website to another. The business model was they would make schools a new website with CMS and they had to move their old content over to the new website. That was where we came in. They hired ~20 interns from Waterloo to do this. This was more about meeting other people from other programs and faculties that otherwise I wouldn't have met.

The company was probably operating under tight money cause the attitude they treated people with kind of showed it. One time they grouped all interns in a room and told us that we made too much noise in the developer area and some people were abusing their tight time clock-in and clock-out policy on Citrix (which recorded people down to the second). Another time one of the interns took 4 bagels in one day and they explicitly said they were instating a one bagel policy for each person.

### Co-op 2: SurfEasy (Winter 2017)

This was my second co-op as a QA Analyst at SurfEasy. I'm not sure if it is still in Toronto after it was bought out by Opera and subsequently Symantec (after I left) [Link](https://www.crn.com/news/security/300095161/symantec-acquires-vpn-secure-software-maker-surfeasy-strengthening-its-consumer-security-business.htm). I was mainly aiming for a dev co-op but since I was still in science at the time, my coding was limited, and my lack of experience it proved to be difficult. I also found this in main round (as opposed to continuous round).

I admire the opportunities the people at the company and the company gave me to improve, and the feedback they gave me. I mainly worked on manual qa for their iOS, Android, and desktop VPN apps. I also worked on the iOS mobile automation suite.

### Co-op 3: Okta (Spring 2018)

This was my third co-op and first developer co-op as a software engineer intern at Okta. This marked my third and final co-op in Toronto. Toronto is cool but not really my style.

I was amazed at the tech they provided us. They gave us the brand new macbook pro to develop on. There was a lot to enjoy. They had a dedicated intern coordinator for intern and company events. I had a dedicated team that was supportive, a mentor to ask questions, and gave me a lengthy intern project that allowed me freedom, flexibility, and the ability to ask questions.

The gripes were tiny. I didn't particularly love the small all-hands space/tables. I'm not sure what else to really complain about.

I mentioned this in [My-Story](https://jonathantsang.github.io/my-story) but after the internship of the 5 interns, 4 interns got a return offer and for me Okta decided to not give me a return offer in either a full-time or intern capacity. At the time I was in 3A and I had just completed cs350 and cs341 (so I was not graduating at that immediate moment). My team needed someone to fill the gap so they moved one of the other interns to my team since I didn't go back.

I wanted to include this because not everyone has a sensational performance at their internship and as much of a painful experience it was to be the only intern to not get a return offer, I had to learn from that experience. Firstly, it was my first developer co-op experience and I had a ton to learn professionally and socially.

### Co-op 4: Zenefits (Spring 2019)

This was my fourth co-op and first co-op in Vancouver. I was really aiming for California but it ended up being the best thing that didn't happen cause I loved Vancouver. I would still describe it as my most down-to-earth co-op and my most fun co-op.

The office was only about 30-40 people but it was a nice community where everyone was chill. They had daily lunches all week and a fully stocked fridge with tons of LaCroix.

The downside was I was not working on the product side so I can't really comment on Zenefit's long-term viability or really on the product itself. I never touched the product working on the infrastructure team.

### Co-op 5: LinkedIn

This was my fifth co-op and first co-op in California. Specifically it took place in Sunnyvale.

When I got Okta I was amazed at the stuff they gave. Then I went to LinkedIn and the amount of swag, food, and overall gear from vending machines was insane. It was another level on top of Okta. The great stuff is too much to list off the top of my head `boba on Tuesdays`, `taco tuesdays`, great america intern event, bikes on campus, the gym, free caltrain pass (rip not anymore), etc.

This also proved to be the most challenging intern project out of all of my internships. I had to work with Javascript and Storybook an open-source UI framework I had never heard of before. Coupled alongside working on the UI of pages which based on my past experience wasn't necessarily something I was familiar with. Despite the challenges I was able to almost complete it by the end of the internship.

### Co-op 6: TheTradeDesk

This was to be my final internship that I found externally of WaterlooWorks since CECA wouldn't let me use WaterlooWorks 6 times. I was originally offered the SF location, but I asked for Bellevue since I had just spent the 4 months prior in California at LinkedIn.



## Comparison of co-ops
For purposes of comparison I'm only going to compare Okta (3rd co-op) to TheTradeDesk (6th co-op) for fairness of being software developer jobs.

## Overall Ranks

- Compensation
- Career Growth
- Culture
- Perks
- Facilities
- Hours
- Location
- Intern Program

|                | Okta | Zenefits | LinkedIn | theTradeDesk |
|----------------|------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Compensation   | 4    | 3        | 1        | 2            |
| Career Growth  | 2    | 4        | 1        | 2            |
| Culture        | 4    | 1        | 3        | 2            |
| Perks          | 4    | 2        | 1        | 3            |

| Intern Program | 2    | 3        | 1        | 4            |

### Compensation

US places paid more than CAD.

### Career Growth

This section is pretty subjective mix of my opinions. I put Okta and theTradeDesk tied at 2 cause I think both have amazing potential in the future. LinkedIn is 1 cause it is already an established company owned by Microsoft. Zenefits is 4 out of general risk since it hasn't IPO'd yet and is the wild card.

### Culture

This is weird to talk about since it is more about MY team/experience as opposed to the entire company (but it is hard to rate a huge company's culture in a 4 month span).

### Perks



### Facilities

This was the office space.

### Hours

I had great work-life balance at Zenefits and theTradeDesk since it was a much more relaxed

### Location

### Intern Program

Zenefits and theTradeDesk didn't have intern programs/specific intern events. (theTradeDesk didn't even have other interns) It is also unfair to try to compare them since theTradeDesk internship was done during coronavirus quarantine so any fun events would have been cancelled anyways. Zenefits inches out theTradeDesk cause they had one quarterly event.

## Final Thoughts

I tried to objectively compare the 4 developer co-ops as best as I could but they each occurred at a different stage of my career and each brought different things to the table. The most unfair comparison is theTradeDesk where I had to deal with coronavirus quarantine during ~4 months of the 6 months I was there.
