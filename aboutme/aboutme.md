My name is Jonathan Tsang. Here's a short summary about me:

- I am a 2A student from the University of Waterloo
- I never did any programming in high school, but I was passionate enough to learn it on my own in University, and here I am now
- I like trying new things
- I run this website using Github Pages, Liquid, and Jekyll (This uses the Beautiful-Jekyll Theme)
