                   <p>I'm a (soon to be) CS student that had an unconventional path to Computer Science. Even though I never pursued CS in highschool, I found a passion for wriitng code and solving problems in my own spare time. Eventually I was convinced to switch from my original program of "Science and Business" into the CS program to pursue what I loved to do.</p>
