**This is still a work in progress as I article my time so far at UWaterloo. Look below to see my story going through University.**

# My Story

Coming out of high school I was really passionate for the sciences such as chemistry and physics. I also enjoyed business courses such as economics after taking AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, and participating in DECA. I really like Waterloo's co-op program and I was excited to go to Waterloo in Fall 2014.

I didn't take any Computer Science courses in high school, and in hindsight, I should have at least tried them out while in high school, but I did take a lot of AP courses which occupied my time. (AP Math, AP Physics, AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, AP Chemistry)

## Fall 2014

  <figcaption>My first picture taken in my room at V1. It was taken on the iPhone 3GS. A lot of the photos I took up until Fall 2015 were taken on the iPhone 3GS.(I later got an iPhone 4S) I'm actually amazed at some of the picture I took back then and how they turned out on a pretty mediocre camera. (The phone came out in 2009, so it is about 5 years old in 2014.)</figcaption>

I entered the University of Waterloo Science and Business Program with a specialization in chemistry. I was interested in both facets and I was extremely excited to be a part of the program. The only time I had ever lived away from home for a prolonged period of time was for [Shad Valley](http://www.shad.ca), where I went to Halifax and stayed at Dalhousie University for a month. It was an amazing experience to see the East Coast of Canada. Here's some photos from Shad Valley:

<figcaption>2. We visited some smaller towns built by the rivers. It was an interesting view since I lived in Toronto.</figcaption>

<figcaption>3. Had some delicious lobster while in the East Coast. I actually ate it during our bus trip to PEI, and not in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. </figcaption>

After doing a couple labs in science, and attending my first hackathon ever (Terrible Hack 2), I was amazed at the world of possibility in Computer Science and the future of technology. I wanted to switch into Computer Science at this point.

<figcaption>The winter was pretty snowy that year. The whole campus was covered in a blanket of snow. In the picture on the far left of these three, is a scene near EIT. In the back you can barely make out two figures, one of which is the President of the University of Waterloo, Feridun Hamdullahpur. I was surprised to see him walking out in the frigid cold.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I also participated in Model UN, and got "Best Delegate" at their first in-house committee. I really enjoyed DECA and Model UN in high school, and I continued to participate in those clubs in university. I went to UTMUN, a University of Toronto run Model UN event in Winter 2015 as well.</figcaption>

## Spring 2015

<img src="/my-story/pictures/amiiboplace.png" width="20%" height="20%">

I spent the summer working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I worked with my friend on a website called [Amiiboplace.com](http://amiiboplace.com/), originally to be used for trading and selling amiibos. I decided to use a Wordpress CMS on the website, and I now use it to write and post Smash Bros related news.



## Fall 2015

  <figcaption>I was a Science Orientation Leader in Fall 2015. It was great since I got to help a lot of incoming first-years by answering questions, showing them around, and making them feel welcome to the UW community.</figcaption>

I planned to switch into Computer Science. (The switch would take almost a year since I needed CS 116 and CS 136 and meet certain mark requirements) I met with advisors, and embarked on a long journey to transfer faculties and programs. At the time I was unsure of switching, but when brought with the choice of safety, but chemistry labs I didn't like, or uncertainty, but doing something I enjoyed, I decided to switch programs.

## Winter 2016

I had a co-op placement at Intrafinity (also called School Messenger). While there, I migrated content from school websites. I also worked on some Javascript and regular expressions. I studied Python 3.0 on my own time, looking at the iterative structures.

## Spring 2016
I arrived back for an academic term in the spring. I took CLAS 104, CS 116, Math 135, and Stat 230. I loved CS 116 and the logical application of solving questions using Python. Although Math 135's math proofs were a bit rocky I ended up doing pretty well in the course and by the end I enjoyed the content overall. (Mod and complex-numbers and n-th roots were my favourite concepts taught in the course)
