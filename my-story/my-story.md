# My Story

Coming out of high school I was really passionate for the sciences such as chemistry and physics. I also enjoyed business courses such as economics after taking AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, and participating in DECA.

I didn't take any Computer Science courses in high school, and in hindsight, I should have at least tried them out while in high school.

## Fall 2014

I entered the University of Waterloo Science and Business Program with a specialization in chemistry.

## Winter 2015

After doing a couple labs in science, and attending my first hackathon ever (Terrible Hack 2), I was amazed at the world of possibility in Computer Science and the future of technology. I wanted to switch into Computer Science at this point.

I also participated in Model UN, and got "Best Delegate" at their first in-house committee.

## Spring 2015
I spent the summer working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I worked with my friend on a website called Amiiboplace.com, originally to be used for trading and selling amiibos. I decided to use a Wordpress CMS on the website, and I now use it to write and post Smash Bros related news.

## Fall 2015
I planned to switch into Computer Science. (The switch would take almost a year since I needed CS 116 and CS 136 and meet certain mark requirements)

## Winter 2016

I had a co-op placement at Intrafinity (also called School Messenger). While there, I migrated content from school websites. I also worked on some Javascript and regular expressions. I studied Python 3.0 on my own time, looking at the iterative structures.

## Spring 2016
I arrived back for an academic term in the spring. I took CLAS 104, CS 116, Math 135, and Stat 230. I loved CS 116 and the logical application of solving questions using Python. Although Math 135's math proofs were a bit rocky I ended up doing pretty well in the course and by the end I enjoyed the content overall. (Mod and complex-numbers and n-th roots were my favourite concepts taught in the course)
