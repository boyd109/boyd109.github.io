# My Story

Coming out of high school I was really passionate for the sciences such as chemistry and physics.

## 2014

I entered the University of Waterloo Science and Business Program with a specialization in chemistry

## 2015

After doing a couple labs in science, and attending my first hackathon ever (Terrible Hack 2), I was amazed at the world of possibility in Computer Science and the future of technology.

## Winter 2016

I had a co-op placement at Intrafinity (also called School Messenger). While there, I migrated content from school websites. I also worked on some javascript and regular expressions.
