**This is still a work in progress as I article my time so far at UWaterloo. Look below to see my story going through University. I got the idea to do this from [Robert Elder's UW Journey](http://www.robertelder.ca/my-uw-journey/).**

# My Story

Coming out of high school I was really passionate for the sciences such as chemistry and physics. I also enjoyed business courses such as economics after taking AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, and participating in DECA. I really like Waterloo's co-op program and I was excited to go to Waterloo in Fall 2014.

I didn't take any Computer Science courses in high school, and in hindsight, I should have at least tried them out while in high school, but I did take a lot of AP courses which occupied my time. (AP Math, AP Physics, AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, AP Chemistry)

## Fall 2014

  <figcaption>My first picture taken in my room at V1. It was taken on the iPhone 3GS. A lot of the photos I took up until Fall 2015 were taken on the iPhone 3GS.(I later got an iPhone 4S) I'm actually amazed at some of the picture I took back then and how they turned out on a pretty mediocre camera. (The phone came out in 2009, so it is about 5 years old in 2014.)</figcaption>

I entered the University of Waterloo Science and Business Program with a specialization in chemistry. I was interested in both facets and I was extremely excited to be a part of the program. The only time I had ever lived away from home for a prolonged period of time was for [Shad Valley](http://www.shad.ca), where I went to Halifax and stayed at Dalhousie University for a month. It was an amazing experience to see the East Coast of Canada. Here's some photos from Shad Valley:

After doing a couple labs in science, and attending my first hackathon ever (Terrible Hack 2), I was amazed at the world of possibility in Computer Science and the future of technology. I wanted to switch into Computer Science at this point.

In the back you can barely make out two figures, one of which is the President of the University of Waterloo, Feridun Hamdullahpur. I was surprised to see him walking out in the frigid cold.</figcaption>

## Spring 2015

<img src="/my-story/pictures/amiiboplace.png" width="20%" height="20%">

I spent the summer working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I worked with my friend on a website called [Amiiboplace.com](http://amiiboplace.com/), originally to be used for trading and selling amiibos. I decided to use a Wordpress CMS on the website, and I now use it to write and post Smash Bros related news.

  <figcaption>I attended Terrible Hack 2, my first hackathon, and I was in awe from the projects people created. My friend and I didn't make anything too spectacular, but I was motivated to learn and create things on my own. At the time I didn't know a lot of the people presenting, but I would eventually meet some of them at the Velocity Residence in Spring 2016 and become good friends.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I also was a part of the first ever Model UN in Waterloo called UWaterloo Model G20 as a assistant director of the committee.</figcaption>
  </span>
</figure>

I planned to switch into Computer Science. (The switch would take almost a year since I needed CS 116 and CS 136 and meet certain mark requirements) I met with advisors, and embarked on a long journey to transfer faculties and programs. At the time I was unsure of switching, but when brought with the choice of safety, but chemistry labs I didn't like, or uncertainty, but doing something I enjoyed, I decided to switch programs.

## Winter 2016

I had a co-op placement at Intrafinity (also called School Messenger since they were recently bought over by the West Corporation). While there, I migrated content from school websites. I also worked on some Javascript and regular expressions. I studied Python 3.0 on my own time, looking at the iterative structures. I was really happy that I worked there because I met a lot of amazing co-ops and workers and it really exposed me to the working nature outside of the University academic terms. I made a lot of good friends at the co-op, which I normally wouldn't have since they were in a diverse range of faculties and programs. Now we hang out or study on campus and I'm happy that the co-op experience allowed for me to meet people I normally wouldn't have.

## Spring 2016

I arrived back for an academic term in the spring. I took CLAS 104, CS 116, Math 135, and Stat 230. I loved CS 116 and the logical application of solving questions using Python. Although Math 135's math proofs were a bit rocky I ended up doing pretty well in the course and by the end I enjoyed the content overall. (Mod and complex-numbers and n-th roots were my favourite concepts taught in the course)

<figcaption>I stayed at the Velocity Residence this term. The events were awesome there, and I recommend anyone even slightly interested in entrepreneurship to stay for a term and see if it is right for them. The dinner events where we could talk to start-ups and other speakers was my favourite part of the residence. I really hope I can stay there for more terms in the future. (As of Fall 2016) </figcaption>
<figcaption>The first photo is my velocity sweater I got for staying in the residence. The middle one is a picture of the Communitech sign when I went to their office for a big Velocity dinner, and the last one is a mural of the Google logo, since Communitech moved into Google's old building a lot of paintings were left there.</figcaption>

## Fall 2016 (Present)

I switched my co-op stream around, so I was supposed to be on co-op during this term, but I wanted to take CS 136 and get into the CS program. I took Math 136, Stat 231, CS 136, ENGL 109, and Music 100. It is a little heftier of a term since it has 5 courses instead of 4 courses last term, but overall  a manageable courseload.

I had a TON of pictures so here they are: [Link](/mhacks8/)  
(I have now a dedicated tab for Hackathon photos that way the load times on this page don't get too massive.)  

This was my first experience outside of the country for a hackathon. It took place at Detroit, Michigan at the Masonic Temple. I walked in with a view of Hack the North, but got a different style of hackathon. The venue was a bit run down, but the interaction from people from University of Michigan and other universities was amazing.

## Future

No one can be certain.
