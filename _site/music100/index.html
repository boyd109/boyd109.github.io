<strong>libretto:</strong> A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical.<br />
<strong>chorus:</strong> chorus contains the main idea, or big picture, of what is being expressed lyrically and musically.
<strong>Theme and variation:</strong> involves idea of contrast, theme is presented and played several times where it is varied in melody ,rhythm, dynamics, tempo, or harmony. The theme is recognizably changed and yet recognizably the same.  <strong>meter:</strong> the recurring pattern of stresses or accents that provide the pulse or beat
<strong>texture:</strong> the way different music sounds are combined
<strong>absolute music:</strong> Music that has no meaning outside the meaning of the music itself and the feelings it produces in its listeners
<strong>Program music:</strong> Music that tells some kind of story</p>

<h2 id="medieval">Medieval:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>written primarily to accompany religious services  </li>
  <li>the oldest surviving written music from the middle ages dates from about 800, but may be older  </li>
  <li>later in the period, secular songs, songs with nonreligious tops became popular  </li>
  <li>polphony music containing more than one line started to appear  </li>
</ul>

<p>Plainchant (plainsong):<br />
- Greogrian chant after Pope Gregory I<br />
- polyphonic, one line at a time<br />
- syllabic, one note for every syllable, or melismatic large number of notes per single syllable<br />
- neumatic small number of notes per syllable  </p>

<p>earliest polyphony was organum (12th-13th centuries). Initially, voices added above and below in parallel. Independent movement was an important development.</p>

<p>Kyrie (plainchant)  </p>

<p>Plainchant:<br />
- flowing rhythm no clearly defined beat<br />
- single musical line, without harmony<br />
- use of modes, rather than scales  </p>

<p>Secular Song and Polyphony:<br />
- Troubadours and trouveres  </p>

<p>Peritonus Alleluya, Nativitas  (Magister Leonin)  </p>

<p>Two composers created first great collection of compositions Magnus Liber and Organi  </p>

<p>Fundamentals of Medieval Music:<br />
- based on modes, not major scales<br />
- plainchant was sung in unison, with no harmony or accompaniment<br />
- stylized courtly love songs became popular<br />
- instruments varied<br />
- polyphony was invented  </p>

<h2 id="renaissance-era">Renaissance Era:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>rebirth  </li>
</ul>

<p>Three major changes:<br />
- new focus on individual achievement<br />
- greater focus on the daily world than on the spiritual afterlife<br />
- widespread mingling of cultures, facilitated by easier travel and spread of printed materials  </p>

<ul>
  <li>music followed imitation where the opening of the same melody is performed by different voices entering one at a time  </li>
  <li>still primarily modal, although some more modern harmony  </li>
</ul>

<p>A cappella - no instrumental accompaniment  </p>

<p>liturgical music: for the masses<br />
motets: songs that have religious texts but are not part of the actual services<br />
secular: nonreligious songs  </p>

<p>motet: four voice parts, small choir rather than soloists<br />
word painting: echoing the meaning of words in music  </p>

<p>Chansons (France), madrigals (Italy - England): 3 or 4 voices, mostly courtly love songs  </p>

<p>Dance music (see note pp. 113): there was always dance music but once again, publishing served a growing market.  </p>

<p>Instrumental forms -&gt; earliest published instrumental music. Wide variety - pavanes, allemandes, bourees, gigues, rondes, courantes, galliardes, sicilianos, salterellos, etc.  </p>

<p>fundamentals:<br />
- sound is smooth and homogenous<br />
- harmony still primarily based on modes<br />
- most prominent feature is imitation<br />
- vocal genres includes Mass movements, motets, and secular songs<br />
- motets and madrigals: often use word-painting, which can involve dissonance<br />
- instrumental music is either serious and imitatitve or light and dancelike  </p>

<h2 id="baroque">Baroque:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>emphasis on scientific understanding and measurement  </li>
  <li>interest in balance, order, and organization  </li>
  <li>artists highlighted contrasting emotions  </li>
  <li>illusion was highly prized  </li>
</ul>

<p>Vocal forms:<br />
- opera: large scale stage productions featuring music, dance, costumes, and elborate plots and settings<br />
- cantata: short-unstaged operas portraying a single scene<br />
church cantata: religious subject<br />
chamber cantata: secular subject<br />
- oratorio: opera-like work with religious theme, not short<br />
- chorale: protestant hymm sung in unison by the entire congregation with a simple melody and regular rhythm</p>

<p>doctrine of affections (affektenlehre). . . in Baroque terms, music not only ought to arouse emotions - it actually makes the listener experience certain emotions.  </p>

<p>conventions:<br />
- Overture<br />
- Recitatives:  used for carrying forward the plot, simple fast speechlike<br />
- Arias<br />
- Ensembles<br />
- Choruses  </p>

<p>Instrumental Forms:<br />
- concerto: instrumental work based on opposition of two groups<br />
concerto grosso (large concerto) full orchestra and small group of soloists<br />
### solo concerto: full orchestra and single soloist<br />
- sonata: chamber work for a small group<br />
sonata da camera(chamber sonata): movements based on dance rythms<br />
sonata da chiesa(church sonata): more serious movements alternating slow and fast<br />
- dance suite: series of short, contrasting dance movements  </p>

<p>basso continuo: strong bass line in Baroque music.  </p>

<p>dance suite, not for dancing independent genre:<br />
<strong>allemande:</strong> duple, moderate tempo, continuous motion<br />
<strong>courante:</strong> triple. moderate to fast, motion often in running scales<br />
<strong>sarabande:</strong> triple, slow, stately, accent often on second beat<br />
<strong>gigue:</strong> usually 6/8, fst, lively, often imitatitve  </p>

<h3 id="cantata-sacred-and-secular">Cantata (sacred and secular)</h3>
<p>Work for vocalists w\instrumental acc. (choruses added later), poetic text<br />
Italian cantata: 3 genres: lyric, dramatic, narrative  </p>

<h3 id="passions">Passions</h3>
<p>Passion plays (depiction of the last days and Crucifixion of Christ) - earliest known form of European theatre. Not surprising that music is incorporated early on.  </p>

<h3 id="sonata">Sonata</h3>
<p>note that “sonata” is a confusing term that shifts its meaning over time.<br />
several movements or sections of contrasting nature (not essentially different from a suite)<br />
chamber sonata (da camera): dance origin<br />
church sonata (de chiessa): more serious, polyphonic<br />
small # of instruments (1-8)  </p>

<p>Concerto<br />
note later, slightly different, classical sense<br />
Contrast - two groups<br />
either solo concerto or concerto grosso (concertino-small grp, ripieno or tutti (“all”)-large group)  </p>

<p><strong>ritornello:</strong> contrast between the solo instruments and the orchestra<br />
<strong>reformation:</strong> church music:<br />
chorale: hymm with steady rhythm and simple tune usually sung in unison by the whole congregation<br />
oratoria: large-scale work like an opera but is a sacred story not staged. (similar to Passion)  </p>

<p>Bach:
- composed in all Baroque instrumental and vocal styles, except opera<br />
- master of counterpoint and his works have served as models for composers and students ever since<br />
- wrote different music depending on the job he had currently:<br />
early years (organist) primarily organ music<br />
middle years (leading orchestra in Cothen) keyboard and instrumental music<br />
final years (working in a church school in Leipzig) primarily religious   choral music, as well as some final instrumental works  </p>

<p>2 wives, at least 19 children. . . 4 became composers of note (Johann Christoph, Johann Christian, Carl Philipp Emanuel, Wilhelm Friedemann).</p>

<p><strong>prelude:</strong> rambling, improvisatory piece that organists play to fill in before, during, and after church service.<br />
<strong>fugue:</strong> carefully worked out polyphonic composition that uses a theme that occurs in all voices of musical lines</p>

<p><strong>Music Offering:</strong> two fugues, ten canons and a trio sonata by Bach. Shows skill at counterpoint.</p>

<p><strong>fundamentals of baroque:</strong><br />
- instrumental music is as important as vocal music<br />
- opera was invented, with vocal forms divided between recitative and aria<br />
- principal vocal genres are opera, cantata, and oratorio<br />
- principal instrumental genres are sonata, suite, and concerto<br />
- music is organized by a hierarchy of chord and keys (tonal harmony)<br />
- unifying feature of all Baroque music is the basso continuo</p>

<h2 id="classical-period-1750-180025">Classical Period (1750-1800/(25?))</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“age of reason” - applied scientific methods to human society</li>
  <li>elevated science/the rational over religion/faith - rejected superstition, prejudice, and long-held beliefs in favour of what could be measured scientifically</li>
  <li>“All men are created equal” valued individual freedom and equality over the older class system</li>
</ul>

<p>The Enlightenment: late 18th - early 19th century (Age of Reason)  </p>

<p>characteristics of Classical Era:
- balanced melodic phrases<br />
- simple harmonies<br />
- light accompaniment  </p>

<h3 id="genres-of-classical-music">Genres of Classical Music:</h3>
<p>Opera: <br />
comic opera: simpler music, down-to-earth characters, and amusing plots  </p>

<p>Symphony:<br />
overture: instrumental introduction in three short movements: fast-slow-fast (sinfonia)  </p>

<p>Chamber Music:  <br />
duets, trios, quintets, for various instrumental combinations<br />
string quartet: four stringed instruments (two violins, a viola, a cello)  </p>

<p>Alberti Bass: continuously moving pattern of short notes</p>

<p>Forms of Classical Music:
- sonata form: intellectually demanding, composers used it for their most serious ideas(had exposition, development, and recapulation)<br />
- minuet-and-trio-form: third movements in sonatas, symphonies, and string quartets (3/4 meter, moderate tempo)triple metre, AABB	CCDD	AABB (or AB)<br />
- aria form: simple (melody first key, new melody new key, repeated from first key, slightly modified) <br />
- rondo form: fourth movement, fairly lively or catchy tune  </p>

<p>Four-Movement Structure:<br />
1: Sonata, Tonic<br />
2: Aria or Sonata or Theme and Variations, Dominant, Subdominant, or relative minor<br />
3: minuet-and-trio, tonic (trio is sometimes in a different key)<br />
4: rondo or sonata, tonic  </p>

<ul>
  <li>most common is the sonata form  </li>
  <li>galant: Fashionable, up-to-date</li>

<div>
  <p>Final Exam Notes</p>

<p>Beethoven:
- born in 1770, Germany
- Beethoven’s master was Haydn
- clashed, Haydn was old-fashioned and Beethoven was rebellious
- in 1802 revealed he was going deaf</p>

<p>music:
1. crescendos that seem to carry the music forward
2. themes that sound exactly right but are played very quietly or very loud
3. dramatic use of classic structures
4. sudden key changes that fit powerful harmonic logic</p>

<p>symphony #5
- dramatic sounds
- woodwinds and horns echo each other</p>

<p>contribution:
- longer symphonies that use more instruments than the Classical Period traditionally
- expanded the orchestra</p>

<h2 id="romantic-period">Romantic Period</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>post French revolution
Reason						emotion, intuition
Objective						subjective
Formal						spontaneous
Universal						personal</p>
  </li>
  <li>early 19th to beginning of 20th century</li>
  <li>development of modern industry</li>
  <li>growth of democratic governments and national pride</li>
  <li>increased emphasis on individual thoughts and feelings in the creative arts</li>
  <li>manipulate orchestral sounds, orchestration</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamics:
- Classic music doesn’t go beyond piano and forte, romantic music has a much larger range
- more frequent changes and less predictable than music in earlier</p>

<p>Tempo:
- range of tempos increased
- more expressive descriptions</p>

<p>Melodies:
- longer melodies
- highly emotional
- expression of feeling, either intense and strong, others wistful, dreamy, or deeply sad</p>

<p>Harmony:
- expressive device
- modulation (movement among keys) is more frequent
- chromatic melodies and harmonies became much more frequent
- key ended in a different key in which they had begun</p>

<p>Form:
- less structure
- phrases tend to flow into each other rather than being separate</p>

<p>romantic differences from classical:</p>

<p>program music: tells some kind of story
absolute music: no meaning outside the meaning of the music itself</p>

<ul>
  <li>opera and symphony were the most extensive genres</li>
  <li>voice was the central component of two Romantic genres song and the Requiem Mass</li>
  <li>concerto was a favoured orchestral genre</li>
  <li>chamber music was also popular in the nineteenth century</li>
</ul>

<p>instruments:
- favourite instruments were the piano and the violin
- piano has intimacy and great drama, the violin has a wide range and potential for lyricism
- cello and the french horn wer able to express rich tenor range
- special effects, composers turned to the English horn (tenor oboe) for a reedy, evocative sound</p>

<p>romantic era:
- romantic songs may be either strophic or through-composed
- strophic songs are those that use the same music for each stanza
- through-composed songs are songs with music different in each stanza
- group of songs is called a song cycle</p>

<p>composers:
- Beethoven- franz schubert
- hector berlioz
- felix mendelssohn
- fryderyk chopin
- robert schumann
- clara schumann
- fanny mendelssohn hensel</p>

<p>virtuosi: talented person in arts
- schubert is different from beethoven, and met once
- beethoven was proud assertive, schubert was gentle, relaxed and lyrical</p>

<p>Rachmaninov Piano Concerto #2
- flows with piano</p>

<p>MUSSORGSKY: Pictures at an Exhibition
- feeling rushed
- pictures come alive
- timpani used like signals
- careful movement is alluded to</p>

<p>TCHAIKOVSKY: Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture:
- regal beginning
- goes through the play of romeo and Juliet</p>

<p>An increased interest in program music.</p>

<p>An increased interest in national musics (folk song, dance, etc.). Not a contradiction - composers focussed on individual heritage, not a pan-European style (i.e., Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Purcell, etc., wrote in essentially the same idiom). Exs. Tchaikovsky: PLAY 1812</p>

<p>Also an increased interest in exoticism: is a genre in which the rhythms, melodies, or instrumentation are designed to evoke the atmosphere of far-off lands or ancient times</p>

<p>RIMSKY-KORSAKOV: Scheherazade
 The Sea and Sinbad’s Ship
 - exotic
 - violin
 - sullen, but still prideful</p>

<p>DVORaK- New World
- exotic
- quieter and has more small sounds</p>

<p>Opera</p>

<p>In Romantic era:</p>

<p>opera (more “real” people and plots, comic “opera buffa” – inversion, lower classes get the upper hand)</p>

<p>Beethoven only wrote one opera - Fidelio</p>

<p>Virtuosity: Opera becomes show business. Star system, individual singers: Caruso, Jenny Lind (the “Swedish Nightingale”), right up to the three tenors (Pavarotti, Domingo, the other guy Carreras), Stratas, Joan Sutherland, Te Kenewa.</p>

<p>“Divas and prima donnas”
Vocal types: colouratura, mezzo soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass
Stereotypical roles: heroine - soprano, hero - tenor, alto - friend or “wicked stepmother,” baritone, friend or villain, bass - villain
“Giantism” - huge orchestras, casts of thousands - see “Aida”</p>

<p>“bel canto” style (Italian) = “beautiful singing” Bellini, “Norma,” Donizetti, “Lucia”</p>

<p>PUCCINI: La bohème from Che gelida manina:
- singing
- music accompaniment in the back
- french</p>

<p>PUCCINI: Turandot - Act III Scene 1: Nessun dorma:
- singing
- harp in the back</p>

<p>Nationalism - Operas on national themes with national styles (Russian (“Boris”), Italian (Verdi, “Rigoletto”)</p>

<p>Exoticism - Verdi, “Aida,” Puccini, “Madame Butterfly,” “Girl of the Golden West,” Bizet’s “Carmen,”</p>

<p>Puccini, Madame Butterfly:
- singing
- female
- opera of a young japanese girl and the american navy lieutenant that leaves her pregnant</p>

<p>Above all, 19th C. opera is about melody.</p>

<p>Nationalism</p>

<p>Richard Wagner (1813-1883) (Yudkin 178-82)</p>

<p>Operas: Rienzi, Tannhauser, Flying Dutchman, Tristan and Isolde, Parsifal, Die Meistersinger, Lohengrin, “The Ring” - Das Rhinegold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, Gotterdammerung</p>

<p>born in Leipzig (Bach connection)
virtually self-taught in music, therefore not afraid to try “wrong” approaches.
pivotal figure (like Beethoven)–&gt; bridge from Romanticism to most of the “isms” of the 20th C. –&gt; “expressionism,” “modernism,” “impressionism,”. . .
mostly known for operas and writings. . . no symphonies, little chamber music
has a difficult place in music history.</p>

<p>Comparison with Jean-Luc Goddard
W was a vicious anti-Semite
Until quite recently, was not played in Israel.
Hitler’s favourite composer (though a little unfair since W died long before the rise of National Socialism).
Hitler’s favourite because of W’s subject matter.
DISCUSS: can we love the art but despise the artist (ex.: Miles Davis)?</p>

<p>W provided Germany with a mythological past. Germany was created in the 19th C. . . united principalities of Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony and others.
W took as his subject matter not German history but German/Northern European mythology. Deep well of myth and legend that runs from Scandinavian sagas and mythology through Beowulf and King Arthur. . . exactly the same well that Tolkien drew from in LOTR.
W’s “Ring” (Rhinegold, Die Walkure, Siegfried, Gotterdamerung) bears many similarities to LOTR - a magic ring of power is forged in secret, mighty warriors, a last battle, the supernatural, a “sword that was broken” that is reforged. . .
Also to “Sleeping Beauty,” and other north European fairy tales.</p>

<p>W’s operas differ in many ways from the Italian grand opera tradition
“music drama” - continuous - no set pieces, huge orchestra</p>

<p>Wagner Bridal Chorus” from Lohengrin (Act III):
- here comes the bride
- merry and choir singing</p>

<p>pg. 194-195</p>

<p>2) More are familiar with the following: PLAY  (Act III – Vorspiel under “Elgar” as composer) “Ride of the Valkyries” from Die Walkure
- nationalistic, Wagner</p>

<p>wagner tristan:
- mysterious</p>

<p>Romantic (non-opera) Music Continued
Strophic
Through composed
song cycles - groups of songs on a related theme</p>

<p>Franz Schubert (bio pp.), songs, 9 symphonies (including 8 - “Unfinished”), ch. music.</p>

<p>PLAY   “Die Forelle” (text: Schubart) - (pp. 157-8)
- cyclical

<p>Chopin
Romantic characteristics: Dreamy, rubato. Titles like “Impromptu,” “Nocturne,”
PLAY  Chopin, Prelude in E Minor (pp.165)
- sole piano

<p>Innigkeit – dictionary def. = “poignant intimacy of feeling”
One of those useful German words for which there is no exact English equivalent.
(Zeitgeist etc)</p>

<p>Romantic artist as tortured soul (continued) Schumann, Berlioz,Tchaikovsky</p>

<p>PLAY/discuss Robert Schumann (1810-1856),  Dreaming (Traumerei)  (pp. 167)
- wistful

- melancholy</p>

<p>Madness and creativity – possible bipolar disorder?
Suicide attempt (1854), institutionalized, dead at 46.</p>

<p>PLAY C. Schumann Andante from Piano Trio Op. 17
- Trio
- calm and peaceful
- picks up in a part with a fast moving melody</p>

<p>Absolute Music
Brahms (1833-97), the 3rd “B”
4 symphonies, 4 concertos, a lot of piano music, much chamber music, some choral and vocal music.
we all know at least one piece of Brahms -
“Wiegenlied” “(Lullaby)”
a “romantic” personal life (see pp. 185 for complete bio)
studied w/ Schumann
Schumann had a nervous collapse - B fell in love w/ Schumann’s wife, Clara (a fine composer and performer in her own right). B was torn by this situation.
S died but B did not set up housekeeping w/ C.
Though his personal life was “romantic” his music was controlled in a way that Tchaikovsky’s, for example, was not.</p>

<p>only 4 symphonies. Didn’t write a symphony until after 40. In the shadow of Beethoven (“clomping of giants”)
PLAY   Brahms, “Symph. #4, mvmt 4. (pp. 187)
- traditional romantic
- originality in the pieces with little repetition</p>

<p>Post-Romanticism
Influence of Wagner</p>

<p>Gustav Mahler (1860-1911)
conductor/composer
symphonies, Songs of the Earth
PLAY  Symphony #2: Urlicht (pp. 193)
- mysterious middle</p>

<p>Richard Strauss (1864-1949)</p>

<p>Tone Poems: Ein Heldenlieben, Death and Transfiguration, Also Sprach Zarathustra (PLAY ), Til Eulenspiegel, Don Quixote. . .</p>

<p>Operas: Electra, Salome, Der Rosenkavalier</p>

<p>extreme situations, chromatic harmony, precursor to expressionism</p>

<p>The XX Century</p>

<p>New Directions: the 20th Century
Overview
65 years: from first powered flight to moon landing.
Violent 1st half. . . 2 world wars ( 40 &amp; 30 million dead respectively), Russian revolution
Technology/science explosion
More “isms” in 20th C than rest of music history combined.</p>

<p>Impressionism
Two big names: Debussy and Ravel
In visual art, impressionism was a (mostly French) reaction against “representation,” Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir
characterized by “blurriness,” scenes of middle class and urban life (Monet: pg. 201)</p>

<p>Claude Debussy (1862-1918), piano music, orchestra music (but no symphonies). . . never liked the term “impressionism”
Paris Exposition of 1889</p>

<p>technical questions (demonstrate)</p>

<p>2 important developments: freer harmony and freer rhythm.
think of the “solid blocks” of functional harmony and form as equivalent to perspective in visual art.
emancipation of the dissonance - demonstrate, 9th, 11th, 13th chords, whole tone scale</p>

<p>D - art should be “sensuous” - pleasure</p>

<p>Importance of dance: 3 “scandalous” pieces: Prelude the A of an F, Bolero, Rite of Spring</p>

<p>PLAY  “Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun” (1894)
discuss opening phrase - the beginning of a new music, chromatic, ambiguous rhythm, sensuous.
- opening is movie-like
- opens up slowly</p>

<p>Primitivism, Stravinsky and the Birth of Modern Music
Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971)
Russian, student of Rimsky-Korsakov
3 ballets (note non-absolute music), “Firebird” (1910 ), “Petrushka” (1911), “The Rite of Spring” (1913)</p>

<p>PLAY “Firebird” ( (Kaschei), (conclusion))</p>

<p>PLAY “Petrushka”  – Tableau I “The Shrovetide Fair”</p>

<p>Week 11</p>

<p>WWI was the end of one era and the beginning of another one. OLD world –&gt; European imperial power. NEW world –&gt; World politics.
WWI also created the conditions that led to most of the “isms” of the 20th C.
Technology radically altered the conditions of music “consumption” – radio, recording, etc.</p>

<p>Couldn’t make art in the same old way - all post 1900 music can be seen in this light.
beginning of the “great split” between “art” or “classical” music and the general public.
Art music became introspective, hermetic, inward looking.
Babbitt - “Who Cares If You Listen?” article.</p>

<p>Tonality Rejected
Review Tonality
Wagner –&gt; extreme chromaticism, “unsettled” music depicting extremes of emotion.</p>

<p>Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951)
“Second Viennese School” with students Berg and Webern
trained in the conventional style of German tradition
served in WWI though over 40.
wrote nothing for 8 yrs (1915-23)
left for the US in 1933 with rise to power of Hitler.
amateur painter
was pushing the boundaries of tonality even prior to WWI.</p>

<p>PLAY  “Madonna” from Pierrot Lunaire (1912) pg.208
atonal (define)
“sprechstimme” (define - extension of recitative)</p>

<p>atonal and 12-tone music are not the same thing although it is difficult to hear the difference.</p>

<p>atonal music simply avoids any sense of key in an ad hoc, non-systematic way.</p>

<p>Alban Berg (1885-1975)
atonal expressionist operas: Wozzeck, Lulu (based on the play, “Pandora’s Box” by Wedekind, also made into one of the great silent films. . . without any music by Berg)
extreme “downers.” Wozzeck is a not-too-bright soldier whose wife is unfaithful to him with his commanding officer. . . Everyone dies (except W’s little son), “the horror”)
extreme emotional states, murder, lust, corruption</p>

<p>12-tone is a system of composition that replaces the systems and rules of functional harmony.</p>

<p>tone row - chosen to avoid any sense of key
all the procedures of counterpoint are available: inversion, retrograde, diminution, augmentation, retro-inv., transposition, rotation, etc..</p>

<p>in 12-tone composition, dynamics, orchestration, phrasing, rhythm are all still freely determined by the composer.</p>

<p>PLAY  Schoenberg “Theme and Sixth Variation from Variations for Orchestra, Op.31” (pp.209)
DEMONSTRATE row.</p>

<p>Serialism</p>

<p>In serial composition, the initial choice of materials (the row) controls all aspects of the composition.</p>

<p>The 2nd Viennese School is the origin of this very important stream in “art” music since 1900 –&gt; Babbitt, Xenakis, etc.,
all art movements contain the seeds of their own demise.</p>

<p>play Webern Mvt 3 from Five Movements for String Quartet (1909)  (p. 214)
- random sounding</p>

<p>Tonality Extended</p>

<p>I see three possible reasons for continuing to work in a tonal idiom:</p>

<p>1)	Conservatism
Many composers simply still think the old way of doing things is the better way and don’t think that tonality is “mined out.”
Vaughan-Williams, Holst (PLAY Mars  Planets ), Hindemith to some extent.</p>

<p>2)  Populism/Nationalism
Many composers choose to write accessible music to stay connected with a larger audience:</p>

<p>In the US, Aaron Copland consciously chose to write for a mass audience. Embraced film score writing (won an Oscar). Ballets on American subjects; cowboys, farmers, etc.. Very “American,” democratic idea. . . to write accessible music without compromising artistic integrity.
PLAY   “Fanfare for the Common Man” (pp.220)
PLAY  “Hoedown” from Rodeo</p>

<p>3) Compulsion</p>

<p>Artistic repression in Nazi Germany – “decadent,” “Jewish,” “Negroid” (i.e. jazz) music brutally suppressed.
Schoenberg left Germany for America.</p>

<p>Many composers in eastern bloc countries were forced to conform to “proper socialist principles” and write in a traditional style or face prison or death.
Ideology of “Socialist Realism”
Shostakovich: many symphonies chock full of irony and double meanings that went right over the censors’ heads.</p>

<p>John Cage</p>
