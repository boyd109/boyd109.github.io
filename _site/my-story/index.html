  <p><strong>This is still a work in progress as I article my time so far at UWaterloo. Look below to see my story going through University. I got the idea to do this from <a href="http://www.robertelder.ca/my-uw-journey/">Robert Elder’s UW Journey</a>.</strong></p>

<h1 id="my-story">My Story</h1>

<p>Coming out of high school I was really passionate for the sciences such as chemistry and physics. I also enjoyed business courses such as economics after taking AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, and participating in DECA. I really like Waterloo’s co-op program and I was excited to go to Waterloo in Fall 2014.</p>

<p>I didn’t take any Computer Science courses in high school, and in hindsight, I should have at least tried them out while in high school, but I did take a lot of AP courses which occupied my time. (AP Math, AP Physics, AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, AP Chemistry)</p>

  <figcaption>My first picture taken in my room at V1. It was taken on the iPhone 3GS. A lot of the photos I took up until Fall 2015 were taken on the iPhone 3GS.(I later got an iPhone 4S) I'm actually amazed at some of the picture I took back then and how they turned out on a pretty mediocre camera. (The phone came out in 2009, so it is about 5 years old in 2014.)</figcaption>
  </span>
</figure>

<p>I entered the University of Waterloo Science and Business Program with a specialization in chemistry. I was interested in both facets and I was extremely excited to be a part of the program. The only time I had ever lived away from home for a prolonged period of time was for <a href="http://www.shad.ca">Shad Valley</a>, where I went to Halifax and stayed at Dalhousie University for a month. It was an amazing experience to see the East Coast of Canada. Here’s some photos from Shad Valley:</p>

<p>After doing a couple labs in science, and attending my first hackathon ever (Terrible Hack 2), I was amazed at the world of possibility in Computer Science and the future of technology. I wanted to switch into Computer Science at this point.</p>

In the back you can barely make out two figures, one of which is the President of the University of Waterloo, Feridun Hamdullahpur. I was surprised to see him walking out in the frigid cold.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I also participated in Model UN, and got "Best Delegate" at their first in-house committee.

I went to UTMUN, a University of Toronto run Model UN event in Winter 2015 as well.</figcaption>

<p><img src="/my-story/pictures/break/amiiboplace.png" width="20%" height="20%" /></p>

<p>I spent the summer working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I worked with my friend on a website called <a href="http://amiiboplace.com/">Amiiboplace.com</a>, originally to be used for trading and selling amiibos. I decided to use a Wordpress CMS on the website, and I now use it to write and post Smash Bros related news.</p>

  <figcaption>I attended Terrible Hack 2, my first hackathon, and I was in awe from the projects people created. My friend and I didn't make anything too spectacular, but I was motivated to learn and create things on my own. At the time I didn't know a lot of the people presenting, but I would eventually meet some of them at the Velocity Residence in Spring 2016 and become good friends.</figcaption>

<p><br /></p>

<figure>
  <span>
  <img src="/my-story/pictures/2a/9-1.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" />
  <figcaption>I also was a part of the first ever Model UN in Waterloo called UWaterloo Model G20 as a assistant director of the committee.</figcaption>
  </span>
</figure>

<p>I planned to switch into Computer Science. (The switch would take almost a year since I needed CS 116 and CS 136 and meet certain mark requirements) I met with advisors, and embarked on a long journey to transfer faculties and programs. At the time I was unsure of switching, but when brought with the choice of safety, but chemistry labs I didn’t like, or uncertainty, but doing something I enjoyed, I decided to switch programs.</p>

</figure>

<p>I had a co-op placement at Intrafinity (also called School Messenger since they were recently bought over by the West Corporation). While there, I migrated content from school websites. I also worked on some Javascript and regular expressions. I studied Python 3.0 on my own time, looking at the iterative structures. I was really happy that I worked there because I met a lot of amazing co-ops and workers and it really exposed me to the working nature outside of the University academic terms. I made a lot of good friends at the co-op, which I normally wouldn’t have since they were in a diverse range of faculties and programs. Now we hang out or study on campus and I’m happy that the co-op experience allowed for me to meet people I normally wouldn’t have.</p>

  <figcaption>While in Toronto, I was about to go to Smash at York and play in the tournament for fun. I didn't win my matches, but I met some cool people, and some people that eventually went to the University of Waterloo.</figcaption>
  </span>
</figure>

<h2 id="spring-2016-2b">Spring 2016 (2B)</h2>

<p>I arrived back for an academic term in the spring. I took CLAS 104, CS 116, Math 135, and Stat 230. I loved CS 116 and the logical application of solving questions using Python. Although Math 135’s math proofs were a bit rocky I ended up doing pretty well in the course and by the end I enjoyed the content overall. (Mod and complex-numbers and n-th roots were my favourite concepts taught in the course)</p>

<figcaption>I stayed at the Velocity Residence this term. The events were awesome there, and I recommend anyone even slightly interested in entrepreneurship to stay for a term and see if it is right for them. The dinner events where we could talk to start-ups and other speakers was my favourite part of the residence. I really hope I can stay there for more terms in the future. (As of Fall 2016) </figcaption>
<figcaption>The first photo is my velocity sweater I got for staying in the residence. The middle one is a picture of the Communitech sign when I went to their office for a big Velocity dinner, and the last one is a mural of the Google logo, since Communitech moved into Google's old building a lot of paintings were left there.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I also attended Eng-Hack and worked in a team with some of my friends. We worked on a chatbot that gave Google Maps directions when you put in a location.</figcaption>
  </span>
</figure>

<h2 id="fall-2016-2b">Fall 2016 (2B)</h2>

<p>I switched my co-op stream around, so I was supposed to be on co-op during this term, but I wanted to take CS 136 and get into the CS program. I took Math 136, Stat 231, CS 136, ENGL 109, and Music 100. It is a little heftier of a term since it has 5 courses instead of 4 courses last term, but overall  a manageable courseload.</p>

<figure>
  <span>
  <img src="/my-story/pictures/2b/12-1.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" />
  <figcaption>I went to UWP Hacks and I appeared in one of their photos. I didn't have much time to make a project since I was volunteering for Hack the North 2016, but I did follow some Unity tutorials to make a simple game.</figcaption>

(I have now a dedicated tab for Hackathon photos that way the load times on this page don’t get too massive.)  </p>

<p>This was my first experience outside of the country for a hackathon. It took place at Detroit, Michigan at the Masonic Temple. I walked in with a view of Hack the North, but got a different style of hackathon. The venue was a bit run down, but the interaction from people from University of Michigan and other universities was amazing.</p>

I worked at SurfEasy VPN as a QA Analyst. It is an awesome startup with great culture and talented individuals that believe in their product quality first and foremost. I learned about the development cycle of software in a real work setting, worked in a tight knit team on logging and investigating bugs, and coded some of the iOS mobile automation tests during my time there.</p>

<p>It grew in size, got a new office, and expanded their product line, so the company was doing amazingly well, and I was happy to be able to make a meaningful impact to the company during a time of high growth.</p>

<h2 id="hackathons-and-hackathons">Hackathons and Hackathons</h2>
<p>I tried to code as much as I could during the term and go to as many hackathons as I could.

<br /></p>

<p>There were way too many photos, and it was an amazing experience. Mhacks and hackPrinceton were amazing hackathons in the US, and I highly recommend them to anyone. I actually didn’t even get accept to HackPrinceton, but I still decided to try to get on the bus to try and work on programming as much as I could, and see Princeton University. I went and luckily they let me in. From that point onwards, I think after HackPrinceton, I truly understood my love for hackathons and creating ideas/projects/solutions through coding.</p>
