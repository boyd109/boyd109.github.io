- how to do side projects

I went to the co-op advisor at Waterloo one day and waited an hour in line. One student was asking the advisor what coding languages to learn and how to do side projects. No offense to the student but I was there to ask about potentially dropping co-op and how to end on a co-op term, which were a little more specific to the co-op advisor.

## FAQ

#### A lot of your problems could have been solved with reneging

CECA bans you from WaterlooWorks if you renege for 2 terms (essentially you lose out on the job board). This is essentially the same as being forced to apply externally for jobs and is a major detriment. You can renege when you apply externally for jobs, just not on WaterlooWorks.

#### How were you always interviewing?

I was always applying. Big, small, medium companies. Any companies. Toronto, California, Vancouver, etc. I don't turn down interviews for the simple fact that I can gain practice. For the Summer of 2019 internship I applied to over 300 places and I still went to continuous round.

## Future Thoughts

These are condensed notes. I hope to write more in-depth blog posts about them.

#### What about California?

#### Believe in the unbelieveable (realistically)

I look back and the most remarkable story I had was rejecting "Company123" and getting Okta afterwards. That was so ballsy and I think if you asked me today if I could do it, I couldn't do it. That could have been so bad considering the outlook so far.
